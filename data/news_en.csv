1,China smartphone maker Vivo says to suspend all cooperation with NBA,"Chinese smartphone maker Vivo said on Tuesday it will suspend all cooperation with the National Basketball Association (NBA), joining a series of Chinese firms cutting ties with the league following a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive supporting Hong Kong’s protesters.  Vivo, in a statement published on social media platform Weibo, said it is strongly dissatisfied with Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey’s comments on Hong Kong and the NBA’s stance on the matter.  Vivo was a key sponsor for the upcoming exhibition games to be played in Shanghai and Shenzhen later this week by the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets.

2,China row threatens to upstage league's return to Japan,"The NBA returned to Japan for the first time in 16 years on Tuesday, with pre season action between the Houston Rockets and the Toronto Raptors - but it was the league’s growing crisis in neighboring China that demanded much of the attention. NBA commissioner Adam Silver opened a pre-game news conference talking about the future of basketball in Japan before being peppered with questions about the uproar over a tweet by the Rockets’ general manager in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. General manager Daryl Morey apologised on Monday for any hurt caused by the tweet, which he deleted over the weekend after drawing swift condemnation from China’s government, fans and the team’s partners. But the damage was already done, with Houston losing sponsors and broadcasts in a key market for the National Basketball Association.  In the latest fallout, Chinese state television said on Tuesday it would not air NBA exhibition games played in the country this week. Silver said he had issued an additional statement on the China row on Tuesday in part because of CCTV’s announcement that it would no longer be airing the preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets. “It’s not something we expected to happen. It’s unfortunate,” Silver said of CCTV’s decision. “But if that’s the consequences of us adhering to our values, we still feel it’s critically important to adhere to those values,” he said, stressing the NBA’s commitment to freedom of expression for its employees.

Rockets star James Harden brushed off the situation. “It’s not a distraction. We’re focusing on our team and getting better. We have a great opportunity ahead of us and honestly we’re focused on every single day,” he told a post-game news conference. “Our sole focus is on the Rockets.” But Houston head coach Mike D’Antoni had a much testier response for a reporter after the game, in which the Raptors beat the Rockets 134-129. “I know you have your job to do and ask questions. I’m here to play basketball and coach basketball. That’s what we did tonight. And that’s what we will comment on,” he said. “And if we don’t have any more questions we’re good.” FILE PHOTO: Men walk past a poster at an NBA exhibition in Beijing, China October 8, 2019.

3,Chinese state media slams basketball's NBA in free speech row,"Chinese state media on Wednesday accused the National Basketball Association (NBA) of endorsing violence and peddling a “secessionist pipe dream” in an escalating row over comments by a team official in support of protests in Hong Kong.  The tweet sent over the weekend by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey has angered fans and authorities in China, threatening a business said to be worth more than $4 billion in a country where about 500 million fans consume NBA content.   Morey deleted the tweet backing the Hong Kong protests and apologised on Monday, but Chinese broadcasters, sportswear companies and sponsors have said they are reviewing their ties with the NBA, which has had a presence in China since 1992.  The NBA initially described the anger over Morey’s post as “regrettable,” drawing criticism from U.S. politicians who accused the league of putting its China business ahead of free speech. But league commissioner Adam Silver, speaking Tuesday in Japan before a preseason game between the Rockets and Toronto Raptors, said it was not up to the league to regulate what players, employees and team owners said. On Wednesday, an editorial in the official English-language China Daily accused Silver of “brazenly endorsing Morey’s secessionist-supporting tweet” and giving “a shot to the arms of the rioters of Hong Kong.” “If Silver thinks endorsing the indiscriminate violence the radical Hong Kong protesters are resorting to ... is supporting freedom of expression, then he should think again,” it said. Verwandte ThemenChina row threatens to upstage league's return to JapanChina smartphone maker Vivo says to suspend all cooperation with NBASee more stories The protests were “a bid to liberate the city” and “a secessionist pipe-dream” peddled by demonstrators “to justify their summer hooliganism,” the newspaper added. The protests were sparked by opposition to a law allowing extradition to mainland China, but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy. None of the protesters’ five demands is secession or independence.  The basketball furore also comes against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war, which escalated after Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials on Tuesday. The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper, accused Silver of caving in to political pressure, saying the NBA was treating the Chinese market with arrogant disregard. “Tweeting something offensive to the Chinese people before a series of NBA promotional activities in China only shows a lack of intellect, respect, and responsibility,” it said. In a separate report, the newspaper also said that some Chinese internet users had made “disrespectful comments” about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.  “(It) should remind Western media that for Chinese people, the Hong Kong riots are just like the 9/11, which is horrible and can’t be justified,” the Global Times said.

EVENTS CANCELLED Basketball is the most popular sport in China, with about 300 million people playing the game. The NBA has deals with TV and digital media outlets across the country, and teams have played exhibition games annually since 2014. NBA China, launched in 2008 to run the league’s business, is now worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes. The fallout from the Morey’s tweet continued on Wednesday. The NBA had planned to stage media events in Shanghai this week ahead of a preseason exhibition game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday. Organisers cancelled an event at a Shanghai school on Tuesday afternoon, as well as an open training session with the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday, though a “fans’ night” was still on despite a boycott by Chinese celebrities.             State television has already halted plans to air exhibition games played in China this week, saying a country’s sovereignty and social stability were “not within the scope of freedom of speech.” China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong. Slideshow (4 Images)Chinese online travel agency Ctrip (CTRP.O) said late on Tuesday it had stopped sales of tickets to NBA games as well as NBA-related tour packages, joining a growing list of companies severing ties with the league. “Ctrip firmly opposes any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability,” it said on the social media platform Weibo, adding that it would suspend cooperation with the NBA.

4,NBA fans in China seek refund from Tencent as streaming suspended,"Some Chinese National Basketball Association (NBA) fans have asked for streaming subscription refunds from exclusive service provider Tencent amid a deepening free speech row, a move that could cause the tech giant financial pain. Tencent Holdings renewed its exclusive digital partnership with the NBA in July, securing rights to stream U.S. games in China, a market with an estimated 500 million fans. But the Chinese social media giant behind the ubiquitous app WeChat may now become a corporate casualty of the deepening row sparked by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, who expressed support for Hong Kong protests in a tweet over the weekend. That prompted a furore in mainland China, and local sponsors of the games have pulled out. Tencent halted broadcasting games involving the Rockets over the weekend and later said it would stop broadcasting the entire preseason after NBA commissioner Adam Silver voiced his support for Morey’s “freedom of political expression” on Tuesday. It said users subscribing to the Rockets games can switch to feeds from other NBA teams or apply for a refund. Refunds have become a hot topic online with more than 3 million views on Twitter-like Weibo social media platform on Wednesday. Some users claimed they had received automatic refunds ranging from 20 yuan to 264 yuan ($2.80-$37), depending on what packages they subscribe to. Tencent declined to comment on refunds. The Houston Rockets became the most popular NBA team in China after drafting Chinese player Yao Ming with the first overall pick in the 2002 draft. He became a star and helped build the NBA’s following in China. FILE PHOTO: Tencent company name is displayed at a news conference in Hong Kong, China March 17, 2016.  REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File PhotoTencent extended its NBA partnership through 2024-25 season in July, according to an NBA statement. The value of the deal was not disclosed, but Chinese sports news portal Lanxiong Sports reported it was worth about $1.5 billion.  Nearly 500 million people watched last season’s NBA games on Tencent’s video platform, up threefold since the 2014-15 season, Tencent said in July. Tencent isn’t the only company distancing itself from business dealings with the NBA.

7,China TV drops NBA exhibition games; league defends free speech,"Chinese state television said on Tuesday it would not air NBA exhibition games played in the country this week, heaping pressure on the U.S. basketball league after a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive backing protests in Hong Kong.  Rockets general manager Daryl Morey apologised on Monday for any hurt caused by the tweet, which he quickly deleted over the weekend. But China’s government, fans and the team’s partners were not mollified, resulting in loss of sponsors and broadcasts in the world’s second-largest economy and an important National Basketball Association (NBA) market.  However, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver spoke up for freedom of speech saying it was not up to the NBA to regulate what players, employees and team owners said, nor to adjudicate differences between people around the world. CCTV state television said it strongly opposed Silver’s support of Morey.  Any comments that challenged a country’s sovereignty and social stability were “not within the scope of freedom of speech”, CCTV said, adding it was reviewing its relationship with the NBA. Months of anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong have angered Beijing, which has accused Western governments of stirring up anti-China sentiment. China rejects outside intervention in Hong Kong as interference. Chinese smartphone maker Vivo, a key sponsor for the exhibition games in China, announced on Tuesday it was suspending all ties with the NBA, underscoring the strength of the backlash in the country. Chinese sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd, which has endorsement contracts with several NBA players including Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson and Boston Celtics forward Gordon Hayward, also said on Tuesday it was halting contract renewal negotiations with the league. UNDER FIRE AT HOME The NBA had earlier issued a statement saying it regretted Morey’s remarks, drawing criticism from U.S. lawmakers. But Silver, in Japan for an exhibition game, defended Morey’s right to express his opinions. “It is inevitable that people around the world – including from America and China – will have different viewpoints over different issues,” Silver said in a statement. “It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.” Silver later told a news conference in Japan, where he is attending an exhibition game, that the NBA was not apologising for Morey “expressing his freedom of expression”. Verwandte ThemenChina row threatens to upstage league's return to JapanChina smartphone maker Vivo says to suspend all cooperation with NBASee more stories “I regret, having communicated directly with many friends in China, that so many people are upset, including millions and millions of our fans,” Silver said. The league has worked for years to cultivate the Chinese market and regularly plays exhibition games there. Its top stars, including Rockets guard James Harden, frequently visit to meet fans and take part in promotions with sponsors. “As a league we are not willing to compromise those values,” Silver said, referring to freedom of expression. “I’m sympathetic to our interests here and to our partners who are upset. I don’t think it’s inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.” Silver said the league also supported Brooklyn Nets owner and Alibaba Group co-founder Joseph Tsai, who issued a lengthy statement criticising Morey’s tweet. CHINA ‘VERY CLEAR’ Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang referred to criticism of Morey’s comment by the Chinese Basketball Association, which he said made China’s position “very clear”. “I suggest they pay attention to the reaction of the ordinary Chinese people,” Geng told a regular briefing. Exchanges and cooperation would not work if people failed to understand public opinion and China would take “firm and powerful measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and security”, he said. The NBA’s regular season, to which CCTV owns the exclusive Chinese broadcast rights, begins this month.  Tech giant Tencent Holdings has exclusive internet streaming rights in China, which media reports have said are worth about $1.58 billion. It has said it would temporarily stop showing Rockets games. The decision heaps pressure on the league, which faces criticism on multiple fronts about its handling of the controversy. Its apology on Sunday had disappointed some who see the league as the most progressive of the U.S. sports organizations. Silver has in the past urged players to speak out on issues of concern at home, including questions of police brutality and gun violence. Tencent said in July that 490 million Chinese fans watched NBA programming on its platforms last season, up threefold since the 2014-2015 season.   A pre-season game between the Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers is set for Thursday in Shanghai, with a rematch scheduled for Saturday in Shenzhen. However, organisers abruptly cancelled a Tuesday media event without explanation.

9,"NBA stirs U.S. hornet's nest, faces China backlash over Hong Kong tweet","An increasing number of U.S. lawmakers voiced anger on Monday over the NBA’s response to a Houston Rockets official’s tweet backing Hong Kong democracy protests, raising U.S.-China tensions as talks to end a 15-month trade war resumed.  The National Basketball Association, which has built a huge following and burgeoning business in China, said in a statement it regretted the remarks by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey. A Chinese-language version seemed to go further, with the league saying it was “extremely disappointed” in Morey’s “inappropriate” remarks. That prompted a torrent of criticism in U.S. political circles, with a number of U.S. senators excoriating the league for what they saw as a willingness to allow China to censor free speech and trample other American values for the sake of profit. “The NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights,” Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said in a statement. “In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing.” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a self-described lifelong Rockets fan, wrote in a tweet on Sunday that he had been proud to see Morey “call out the Chinese Communist Party’s repressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong.” “No one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom,” Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer wrote in a tweet. Other legislators accused the NBA, no stranger to U.S. politics, of a double standard when it comes to China. NBA stars and some coaches have been outspoken in their criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has urged players to speak out on issues of concern, including alleged police brutality and gun violence.

The Rockets’ Morey, who was named NBA executive of the year in 2018, tweeted his support for the protests over the weekend. His initial tweet, which he swiftly deleted, included an image captioned: “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.”  Morey apologized on Monday.  “I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,” he tweeted. “I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,” he said, adding that he had since heard and considered other perspectives and noting that his tweets did not represent the Rockets or the NBA. ‘LONG TIME TO REPAIR’ Morey’s support for the democracy protests, now in a fourth month, angered Beijing, Chinese fans and the team’s partners in a key market.

Some Chinese fans called for a boycott of the Rockets, who are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted Chinese player Yao Ming in 2002. Yao became a star and helped build the NBA’s following there. An NBA logo is seen on the facade of its flagship store at the Wangfujing shopping street in Beijing, China October 8, 2019.

Chinese technology company Tencent also said it would temporarily stop streaming Rockets games. CCTV said Morey’s apology did not go far enough. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-controlled Global Times newspaper, tweeted on Monday: “If the Rockets want to keep its Chinese market, the team need to avoid offending Chinese public.” Joseph Tsai, owner of the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets and co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), said the damage from Morey’s tweet “will take a long time to repair.” The NBA sought to contain the damage, saying in its statement that it recognized that Morey’s views had “deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.”   “We are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey,” the league said in the Chinese-language version of its statement. The NBA added, “we have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together”. TRADE TALKS The controversy over Morey’s initial tweet and the NBA’s handling of it arrived at a particularly delicate time in U.S.-China relations, which have soured as a result of the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the two sides on each other’s imports.

10,Investors get lost in Big Oil's carbon accounting maze,"Wide variations in the way oil companies report their efforts to reduce carbon emissions make it difficult to assess the risk of holding their shares as the world shifts away from fossil fuels, senior fund managers say. Investors have poured money into so-called sustainable funds, which take into account companies’ environmental, social, legal and other standards, and funds are under pressure from their customers and authorities to make those standards robust. Fund managers are also applying environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria more widely in traditional investments to help them judge how companies will fare over the long term. There is a growing realization that some companies’ profits will shrink faster than others as governments prioritize low-carbon energy to meet the U.N.-backed Paris agreement’s goal of cutting emissions to “net zero” by the end of the century. But oil and gas companies are among the biggest dividend payers, and major funds are reluctant to divest from them, arguing that by staying in they are in a better position to pressure companies to improve. “Do investors have the data that we need? No, I don’t think we have the data that we need at all,” said Nick Stansbury, investment strategist at British insurer Legal & General’s investment management unit, Britain’s biggest asset manager with around $1.3 trillion under management. “Disclosure is not necessarily so we can seek to change the numbers, but so we can start understanding and pricing the risks,” Stansbury said. “A THOUSAND WAYS TO PARIS” There are many voluntary initiatives and frameworks to unify carbon accounting and target setting; some overlap but none have been universally adopted. Further projects exist for other greenhouse gases such as methane. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol is one such set of standards, established by non-governmental organizations and industrial groups in the 1990s. Companies can report their progress in line with these standards through non-profit CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, which then ranks them. Norway’s Equinor comes first in its list of 24 oil major companies, but not all of them report in every year. (GRAPHIC: Big oil ranking by the CDP - here.jpg)     There is also the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), created by the G20’s Financial Stability Board, as well as industry bodies, in-house models at oil firms and banks and third-party verifiers and consultants. “There are a thousand ways to Paris,” London-based BP’s Chief Executive Bob Dudley said at a Chatham House event earlier this year referring to the 2015 accord aiming to keep global warming well below 2 degrees. BP Finance Chief Brian Gilvary told Reuters BP would welcome more consistency within the sector to show what oil companies are doing about emissions and that an industry body, the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), was discussing carbon accounting. A plethora of third party ESG verifier companies were emerging with varying ways of measuring ESG metrics, he said, adding that some such firms would say to an oil company, “We believe your score is this, and, by the way, if you spend $50,000 we’ll show you how you can improve that score.” UBS, with $831 billion of invested assets, has $2 billion in its Climate Aware passive equity strategy, which is in part based on a company’s emissions reporting. In that strategy “we tilt towards companies that are better performing on a range of climate metrics and away from companies that do not perform so well in this respect,” Francis Condon, executive director for sustainable investing, said. “We don’t want to be accused of greenwashing or falling for it,” he said, adding that UBS regularly encouraged companies to prepare for the climate transition. Using a broad measure, global sustainable investment reached $30.1 trillion across the world’s five major markets at the end of 2018, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Review. This equates to between a quarter and half of all assets under management, due to varying estimates of that figure. Condon said most investors were still more focused on returns than wider sustainability criteria but were becoming concerned that companies may expose them to possible future climate-related financial losses. “There is a very limited appetite for giving up performance for higher ESG. The question is more: is management taking on risks it can’t manage?” To try to answer that question, the world’s biggest financial service providers are investing in companies which provide ESG-related data. This year alone, Moody’s bought Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven, MSCI bought Carbon Delta and the London Stock Exchange bought Beyond Ratings. S&P acquired Trucost in 2016.  Independent climate risk advisors Engaged Tracking say they attracted two-thirds of their clients in the past year. All six companies provide data, assessments and consulting on the climate exposure of companies or bonds. HOW TO COUNT A central issue, discussed at European oil majors’ shareholder meetings this year, is how they deal with the emissions caused by the products they sell, such as gasoline or kerosene, which are known as Scope 3 emissions. (GRAPHIC: Oil Majors' Carbon emissions - here)     Such emissions are typically around six times larger than the combined emissions from oil companies’ direct operations and power supply, also known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions, according to Reuters calculations. Even if a company publishes Scope 3 data, there are 15 different categories based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. These include use of sold products such as fuel alongside secondary factors such as business travel or employee commuting. Constantine Pretenteris at Engaged Tracking said some companies achieved a high score for comprehensiveness by disclosing data for most of the Scope 3 categories, but left out the key ones, such as emissions from use of their fuel. “We would love to see a general standard which makes comparisons easy,” Sven Reinke of Moody’s said. “It doesn’t fully exist these days.” RELATIVE OR ABSOLUTE The majority of climate-related targets are based on intensity measures, which means absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls. Total recorded Scope 3 emissions from the world’s top public oil companies are still rising, largely due to rising oil and gas output, according to Reuters calculations based on data carried on Refinitiv’s Eikon platform and company websites. They showed combined Scope 3 emissions recorded by BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips’, Chevron, Eni, Total, Equinor and Repsol rose around 1.6% over 2018, after a 1% similar rise the previous year. Individual figures vary according to the metrics a company chooses to include. Conoco said its Scope 3 emissions had fallen 5%, while the other companies’ individual recorded Scope 3 emissions either rose or stayed roughly the same. Asked for comment, BP and Chevron pointed to absolute targets related to their own operations. Total pointed to progress it had made towards lowering emissions intensity per unit produced. Shell and Repsol referred to their short-term intensity-based targets and Equinor said it could not take responsibility for emissions it does not control. U.S. firm Exxon did not reply to a request for comment. Eni had no immediate comment. Top oil companies have boosted investment in renewable energy and low-carbon technology in recent years, particularly in Europe, but much bigger sums are still going into developing oil and gas. “We cannot change the patterns of consumption around the world - we cannot make people fly less. We can reduce the carbon intensity of the products we sell,” Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in June. Mark Lewis from BNP Paribas and a member of TCFD, said overall cuts were what would count in the end. Repsol is currently the only major oil company to have set absolute reduction targets for all its output. “The Paris Agreement is all about a carbon budget and that’s an absolute number. It’s not an intensity number,” Lewis said. “The atmosphere works in terms of absolutes not intensity.” In the meantime, some investors are avoiding oil companies which others say should be supported for going further than many of their peers. London-based investment management firm Sarasin & Partners said in June it was selling down its stake in Shell because its spending plans were out of synch with international climate targets. Asked for comment, Shell pointed to comments from representatives of the pension funds of the Church of England and Britain’s government Environment agency, which praised the company’s transparency and said others should follow its lead.

11,Birthplace of U.S. civil rights movement elects first black mayor,"Montgomery, the capital of the southern U.S. state of Alabama, known as the birthplace of the civil rights movement for its 1950s bus boycotts over segregated seating, has elected the first black mayor in its 200-year history. Steven Reed, a county probate judge who is black, defeated David Woods, a white businessman who owns a regional television station, unofficial results posted online by the city show, by winning 67 percent of the vote in a nonpartisan runoff. Media photographs online showed Reed supporters holding up campaign T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan, “We made history,” in the city of about 200,000, about 60 percent of whom are African American, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. “This election has never been about me,” Mayor-elect Reed said in his victory speech late on Tuesday, according to the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper. “This election has never been about just my ideas. It’s been about all the hopes and dreams we have as individuals and collectively in this city.” Reed’s victory came in a city still getting to terms with its past. It was the first capital of the Confederate States of America in 1861. Last year, the Equal Justice Initiative opened the National Memorial for Peace and Justice and the Legacy Museum in downtown Montgomery to honor victims of lynching in the racially segregated era after the U.S. Civil War. The city is the site of the Montgomery bus boycott, a year-long civil rights protest that started in 1955, led by black seamstress Rosa Parks, who refused to give up her seat to a white patron, as the law then required, and was famously jailed. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ordered Montgomery to integrate its bus system, and one of the boycott leaders was the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., who would emerge as the most prominent leader of the American civil rights movement. Reed was also the first African-American elected the county’s probate judge in 2012, the Advertiser said. In 2015, he was the first probate judge in Alabama to issue same-sex marriage licenses. Reed is scheduled to be sworn into office on Nov. 12 at city hall. ",Politik,2019-10-09 00:00:00,Reuters
12,Exclusive: Democrats willing to risk 2020 chances to impeach Trump - Reuters/Ipsos poll,"Most Democrats want to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump, even if that means weakening their party’s chances of winning back the White House in the 2020 election, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. The poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday, found that 55% of Democrats said that their party leaders should press ahead with impeachment even “if it means a lengthy and expensive process that could weaken their chances of winning the presidency in 2020.”  And even a higher number - 66% of Democrats - agreed that Congress should pursue impeachment, “even if that means they will need to postpone efforts to pass laws that could benefit me.” Overall, the poll found that support for impeachment remains unchanged overall among all Americans - holding at 45% since last week. But opposition to impeachment dropped by 2 percentage points from last week to 39%. Among those who identify as Democrats, 79% said Trump should be impeached, up 5 percentage points from a similar poll that ran Sept. 26-30. Only 12% of Republicans and about 1 in 3 independents supported impeachment, which is mostly unchanged from last week. Full poll results: here.pdf Support for impeaching Trump had been rising since late September after an unidentified U.S. intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint accusing the president of pressuring Ukraine to ensnare Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son in a corruption investigation. Biden, the former vice president, is an early favorite to win the Democratic presidential nomination, and opinion polls show that he fares better than other Democrats including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in a hypothetical general election matchup against Trump. The whistleblower complaint, denounced by Trump as a “witch hunt” carried out by his political enemies, has since been backed up by a second unidentified whistleblower who has more direct knowledge than the first of some of the allegations in the complaint, according to the person’s lawyers. Trump, who says he was acting out of his duty to root out corruption, said last week that China should also investigate Biden. Overall, the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that 51% of all Americans agreed that Trump “pressured” Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens, while 27% disagreed.  And 59% agreed that Congress should investigate “if President Trump committed impeachable offenses” as part of his conversation with Zelenskiy. In general, 39% said they approved of the job Trump was doing and 55% disapproved. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the poll shows how much Democratic voters have lined up behind Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and moderate House Democrats who had been cautious about pursuing an impeachment inquiry earlier this year. “That phone call (between Trump and Zelensky) changed everything,” Kamarck said. “The moderates, Speaker Pelosi, they changed their minds in a very public way in favor of impeachment. They’ve been making their case to the public, and some of them have followed.” Democratic voter Moneque Jarmon, 51, from Philadelphia said she doubted Trump would be removed from office through the impeachment process. But it was important to set a precedent that the president is accountable for his actions, she said.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,118 adults, including 454 who identify as Democrats and 457 who identify as Republicans. It has as credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 5 percentage points.

13,Trump and U.S. Democrats jockey for position in deepening impeachment battle,"The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives was set on Wednesday to step up its impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump over his dealings with Ukraine, as the White House declared it would not cooperate with the probe. The three congressional committees leading the inquiry were working on final arrangements to interview a U.S. intelligence officer who filed the whistleblower complaint that triggered the probe, a day after the State Department abruptly blocked the U.S. ambassador to the European Union from speaking to them. The investigation is focused on whether Trump used almost $400 million in congressionally approved aid to Ukraine as leverage to pressure the Ukrainian president to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump’s main Democratic rivals as he seeks re-election in 2020. Trump has denied wrongdoing. White House Counsel Pat Cipolline wrote on Tuesday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats that the administration would refuse to cooperate with what it called an “illegitimate” and “unconstitutional” impeachment inquiry. “The effort to impeach President Trump ... is a naked political strategy that began the day he was inaugurated,” Cipolline’s letter added. Pelosi said in response to the letter: “Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.” She did not indicate what steps, if any, House Democrats might take to compel Trump’s cooperation. In addition to the whistleblower, lawmakers aim to hear later this week from a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump removed from that post last May before her term was up. Lawyers for the whistleblower were focused on how to protect the person’s identity from being made public during any testimony, according to sources close to the talks.

REUTERS/Leah MillisThe showdown between Trump and Pelosi heightened just as a newly released Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Democratic support rising for impeachment. At the same time, 45 percent of all adult Americans said they support impeachment while 39 percent oppose it, unchanged from last week. RELATIONS RAW Relations between Democrats and Republicans in Congress were already raw when the State Department on Tuesday ordered U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a major Trump political donor, not to appear at a closed-door meeting of three U.S. House panels investigating Trump. Democrats view Sondland as a key witness who could help shed light on whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure it to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had business dealings in Ukraine. Trump has alleged corruption by the Bidens, but has not provided any evidence to back that up. The move prompted Democrats to accuse Trump of obstructing their investigation and Republicans to accuse Democrats of operating a secretive, biased inquiry. The hot rhetoric in the high-stakes battle between Trump and Democrats who control the House is expected to intensify next week when Congress returns from a two-week recess. On their return, members will huddle privately to discuss strategy if Pelosi decides in coming weeks or months to go ahead with articles of impeachment against Trump. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would have no choice but to initiate a Senate trial on whether to convict Trump of any formal charges of “high crimes or misdemeanors” lodged by the House. Slideshow (2 Images)But he added in an interview with CNBC: “How long you’re on it, is a whole different matter,” possibly referring to the right of any senator to move to dismiss the charges, thus short-circuiting a full-blown Senate trial and a vote on convicting Trump - if the motion were to be approved. Republicans who control the Senate have shown little appetite for ousting Trump. ",Politik,2019-10-09 00:00:00,Reuters
14,EU tells British PM Johnson to stop playing 'stupid' Brexit blame game,"The European Union accused Britain of playing a “stupid blame game” over Brexit on Tuesday after a Downing Street source said a deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands. With just 23 days before the United Kingdom is due to leave the bloc, the future of Brexit remains deeply uncertain as both London and Brussels position themselves to avoid blame for a delay or a disorderly no-deal Brexit. In a sign that Johnson’s last-ditch proposals to bridge the Brexit impasse have failed, a Downing Street source said Merkel and Johnson had a frank exchange on Tuesday morning and she had made clear that a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”. The Downing Street source said that if Merkel’s position on Northern Ireland remaining in the EU’s customs union was the bloc’s position, then a deal was impossible. The biggest hurdle to a deal remains the post-Brexit border arrangements between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.  “If this represents a new established position then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever,” the Downing Street source said. Johnson insists Northern Ireland must leave the EU’s customs union with the rest of the UK. A spokesman for the German chancellor confirmed the call had taken place but declined to comment further. However, Norbert Roettgen, a senior Merkel ally, said there was no new German position on Brexit. “Frankly a deal on the basis of Johnson’s proposals by Oct. 31 has been unrealistic from the beginning...,” he said on Twitter.

The EU was scathing about Johnson’s stance. “Boris Johnson, what’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,” European Council President Tusk said on Twitter. “At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don’t want a deal, you don’t want an extension, you don’t want to revoke, quo vadis?” Such abrupt remarks indicate the Brexit blame game has begun in earnest, and that now both London and EU capitals are preparing for an acrimonious and potentially chaotic Brexit for which neither side wants to be held responsible. Adding to the gloom, European Parliament President David Sassoli said after meeting Johnson on Tuesday there had been no progress in the Brexit talks. “If his ideas are limited to what he presented to the negotiator (Michel) Barnier five days ago, it means that he doesn’t actually want an agreement,” Sassoli, an Italian, told reporters, speaking through a translator in London. However, a Downing Street spokesman reiterated that Johnson wanted to leave the EU with a deal and said the proposals he had made last week respected both the Good Friday peace agreement on the island of Ireland and the EU’s single market. Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar reiterated their desire for a Brexit deal in a phone conversation on Tuesday evening and agreed to meet later this week, a Downing Street spokesperson said.

Aaron Chown/Pool via REUTERSBREXIT BLAME GAME A disorderly Brexit could rip apart the United Kingdom, endanger peace in Northern Ireland, hurt global growth and shape the future of the European Union, which was built on the ruins of World War Two. An array of remarks by unidentified British sources laid bare just how far apart the two sides are after three years of tortuous haggling over the first departure of a sovereign state from the EU. Brexit talks are now reaching a critical moment, a British spokesman said in Brussels, where Johnson’s Brexit negotiator David Frost was in meetings with EU officials. A separate Downing Street source told Reuters that unless the European Union compromises and does a Brexit deal shortly, then the United Kingdom will leave without a deal. Arlene Foster, the leader of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party that supports Johnson’s government, accused the EU and Ireland of trying to trap the British province in a permanent customs union. Ireland braced for the worst with a no-deal Brexit budget while Britain announced its no-deal tariff plan and updated its preparations for a no-deal exit - a nightmare scenario for many big businesses. Johnson has consistently said the United Kingdom will leave the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal, though a law passed by parliament demands he write a letter to the EU asking for a delay if he cannot strike an exit deal by Oct. 19. He has said he would abide by the law but Britain would leave the EU by the end of the month, without explaining that contradiction. He has also repeatedly demanded an election but parliament has refused to grant one. Slideshow (3 Images)Scotland’s top court will rule on Wednesday whether to order Johnson to abide by the law forcing a delay and if it could sign a letter asking for an extension if he refuses to do so himself. The Spectator magazine quoted an unidentified source in Downing Street as saying that Britain would take an aggressive stance toward the EU if Brexit talks break down, possibly even by withholding security cooperation. “This government will not negotiate further so any delay would be totally pointless,” the source was quoted as saying. “We’ll either leave with no deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with no deal.” ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters

FILE PHOTO: An investor sits in front of a board showing stock information at a brokerage office in Beijing, China, December 7, 2018.  REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File PhotoMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.61%. Chinese shares .CSI300 fell 0.32% after briefly touching a five-week low. Australian shares  were down 0.76%. Pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures STXEc1 edged up 0.03%, German DAX futures FDXc1 rose 0.03%, while FTSE futures FFIc1 eased 0.08%. The U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled further interest rate cuts and the resumption of bond purchases to address a recent spike in money markets rates. Oil prices extended declines as U.S. visa restrictions on Chinese officials and the addition of more Chinese companies to a U.S. trade blacklist weighed on already slim hopes that Washington and Beijing could reach a truce at trade negotiations this week. The United States and China are engaged in a year-long row that has slowly expanded beyond trade policy, suggesting even more damage to an already fragile global economy. “Stock markets are still trying to price in the slowdown in global growth,” said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co in Tokyo. “The dispute between the United States and China shows no sign of ending. We’re losing confidence in the U.S. economy. There’s more uncertainty about where the Fed is really headed.” U.S. stock futures ESc1 rose 0.16%, but sentiment was weak after the S&P 500 ended 1.56% lower on Tuesday in response to the U.S. visa restrictions. Japan's Nikkei .N225 slid 0.73%, its biggest decline in a week. Hong Kong shares .HSI fell 0.68% due to persistent worries about often violent protest against China's rule of the former British colony. Shares fell in Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) suppliers in Greater China, such as Luxshare Precision (002475.SZ) and O-Film Tech (002456.SZ), after China’s state media criticized the iPhone maker for an app use by Hong Kong protesters. The U.S. State Department announced the visa restrictions just a day after the U.S. Commerce Department cited the mistreatment of Uighur Muslims in China in its decision to add 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies to a trade blacklist. The U.S. moves cast a pall over U.S.-China trade talks in Washington, where deputy negotiators met for a second day to prepare for the first minister-level meetings in more than two months on Thursday and Friday. Washington is also moving ahead with discussions about restrictions on capital flows into China, Bloomberg reported. Tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the United States and China have roiled financial markets and slowed capital investment and trade flows. U.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs on Chinese imports will rise on Oct. 15 if no progress is made in the negotiations. In currencies, the onshore yuan CNY=CFXS opened at its weakest since Sept. 6 but then traded relatively flat at 7.1434 per dollar.

(GRAPHIC: Bank reserves held at the Fed - here.jpg) The spread between two-year and 10-year Treasuries, the most common definition of the yield curve, widened to 11.3 basis points. The Fed’s Powell, in a speech on Tuesday, flagged openness to further rate cuts and said the time to allow the Fed’s asset holdings to begin to expand again “is now upon us.” The U.S. central bank had been shrinking its balance sheet as it unwound crisis-era bond buying programs. Recent volatility in U.S. money markets raised concern the Fed’s balance sheet had become too small, leaving banks with inadequate reserves. Powell said balance sheet expansion should not be read as an effort to stimulate the economy, but weak data on the U.S. manufacturing and services sector last week rattled investors’ confidence that the U.S. economy remained robust. U.S. crude CLc1 fell 0.48% to $52.38 per barrel. Brent crude LCOc1 fell 0.41% to $58.00 a barrel.  A larger-than-expected increase in U.S. crude inventories added to fears that the global oil market will continue to struggle with excess supply. ",Top-Nachrichten,2019-10-09 00:00:00,Reuters
16,White House calls House impeachment probe unconstitutional,"The White House on Tuesday rejected an impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats in the House of Representatives as “constitutionally invalid” and said it would refuse to cooperate with the probe absent a vote of the full House. FILE PHOTO: The White House is seen through a metal gate in Washington, U.S., October 6, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott/File PhotoAn eight-page letter signed by White House counsel Pat Cipollone was sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. Democrat, and the Democratic chairs of the House intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees. Pelosi argues the impeachment inquiry she launched is constitutional and that no House vote is necessary at this juncture. The inquiry was started based on accusations from a government whistleblower that President Donald Trump sought Ukraine’s help in investigating Democratic rival Joe Biden. The White House argued that the three other impeachment inquiries in American history, against presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, all included House votes, and that this should serve as precedent for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. “Proceeding without a House vote is unprecedented in the history of our nation. In every prior occasion for a presidential impeachment inquiry there has been a vote of the House,” said a senior administration official, speaking as the letter was released. The letter said Trump has been denied basic due process rights, such as to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses to testify, receive transcripts of testimony, and have access to evidence. “All of this violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent,” the letter said. It said the Supreme Court has recognized that due process protections apply to all congressional investigations. The letter was the result of an intense behind-the-scenes effort in recent days by White House lawyers to respond to the Democrats’ impeachment bid. One concern the White House has involves the whistleblower. House Democrats are working to protect the identity of the person who has accused Trump of impropriety in his dealings with Ukraine. “There shouldn’t be a situation where you can have a primary witness, an accuser in an impeachment inquiry, and the president never able to know who the accuser is and never able to cross examine him,” said the senior administration official. Trump has called the inquiry a partisan “witch hunt,” and released a summary transcript of his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a bid at damage control. The letter argues - a contention denied by the Democrats - that the impeachment effort is simply aimed at reversing the result of the 2016 presidential election and influencing the 2020 election. “The decision as to who will be elected president in 2020 should rest with the people of the United States, exactly where the Constitution places it,” said the letter.

17,U.S. lawyer Michael Avenatti gets trial date on charges of stealing from ex-client,"Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who became nationally known as an outspoken critic of U.S. President Donald Trump before his arrest earlier this year, will stand trial in April on charges that he stole from his former client Stormy Daniels, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. Attorney Michael Avenatti arrives at the  United States Courthouse in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 8, 2019.  REUTERS/Brendan McDermidU.S. District Judge Deborah Batts set the April 21 trial date at a brief hearing in Manhattan federal court. The trial is expected to last one to two weeks. Avenatti, 48, was arrested in New York in March. New York prosecutors have charged him with stealing nearly $300,000 from Daniels in the course of representing her and helping her secure a book deal, to which he has pleaded not guilty. The prosecutors said Avenatti diverted two $148,750 installment payments from Daniels’ $800,000 book advance by forging her signature in a letter to her literary agent and directing that the money be sent to his bank account. Avenatti eventually paid $148,750 to Daniels after obtaining the funds from another source, according to prosecutors. However, when Daniels asked about the second payment, Avenatti falsely told Daniels the publisher “owes me a payment” and that he was “on it,” prosecutors said. Avenatti’s lawyer, Dean Steward, said at Tuesday’s hearing that he was considering filing a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that it was motivated by the “vindictiveness” of Avenatti’s political enemies in the Trump administration. Batts, however, expressed skepticism. “This office is not known for being vindictive,” she said of the Manhattan federal prosecutors who brought the charges. Avenatti is charged in a separate federal case in New York with trying to extort Nike Inc. Prosecutors in that case have accused Avenatti of threatening to publicize claims that Nike arranged for payments to elite college basketball recruits unless the athletic wear company paid him more than $20 million and hired him to manage an internal probe. A trial in that case had been scheduled for November, but Avenatti has asked that it be postponed until January. He is also charged by federal prosecutors in Los Angeles with stealing millions of dollars from clients to pay for personal and business expenses and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a Mississippi bank about his finances. A trial in that case is scheduled for May 19. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; ",Politik,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters

REUTERS/Paulo WhitakerPresident Donald Trump’s government has imposed sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials as well as state oil company PDVSA in an effort to remove Maduro, whom it accuses of fixing elections last year and abusing human rights in the oil-rich nation.  Senators Marco Rubio and Robert Menendez sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review transactions by JBS, which has bought several American meat companies in recent years, Rubio’s press office said on Twitter. “This meat-processing conglomerate has engaged in illicit financial activities and has business ties with the Maduro regime,” the Twitter post said. In a statement, JBS said it had always cooperated “transparently” with U.S. authorities regarding “passed events” in Brazil. It had improved the management of the companies it acquired in the United States, delivering “solid results” that contributed to farm sector growth, JBS added, and continues to provide opportunities to farming and cattle-raising families. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In August, Washington froze all Venezuelan state assets in the United States and threatened sanctions on any company continuing to do business with the government.  In their letter to Mnuchin, made public on Tuesday, the senators said CFIUS should investigate the business transactions among JBS, the Venezuelan Corporation of Foreign Trade (CORPOVEX) and Diosdado Cabello, a powerful ally of Maduro who is under U.S. sanctions. They did not provide further details about the alleged transactions. The senators said JBS had engaged in the bribery of public officials in Brazil to obtain funds to expand abroad, acquiring in recent years U.S. meat-packer Swift Foods Co and chicken producer Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. Brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, founders of JBS’s holding company J&F, signed plea bargain and leniency deals in May 2017, in which they confessed to running a political bribery ring in Brazil. “We ask CFIUS conduct a review of JBS SA’s acquisition of U.S. companies to assess the implications for security and safety of America’s food supply and, in turn, our national security,” the senators said in their letter.

Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan, British Minister for Northern Ireland Julian Smith, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, Health Minister Matt Hancock and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox are all on a ""resignation watch list"", according to The Times report bit.ly/33fODZW. An unnamed cabinet minister cited by the newspaper said that a “very large number” of Conservative members of parliament will quit if it comes to a no-deal Brexit.  The Times said that ministers had warned Johnson in a cabinet meeting about the “grave” risk of the return of direct rule in Northern Ireland and raised concerns about Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s top adviser. “Cabinet will set the strategy, not unelected officials. If this is an attempt to do that then it will fail”, the report quoted another cabinet minister as saying. While the Times newspaper did not specify how many Conservative lawmakers oppose a no-deal scenario, the Financial Times reported early on Wednesday that at least 50 members of parliament from the party will revolt against a general election manifesto pledging to pursue a no-deal Brexit. Certain lawmakers from the party are considering running on a softer individual Brexit platform or even standing aside altogether as a Tory candidate, the FT report added on.ft.com/2Mr4RIF.

Power will be turned off to communities in stages, starting in northern California, just after 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, depending on the timing of high-wind conditions locally, PG&E said in a statement. Sustained gale-force winds were expected to last through midday Thursday, with isolated gusts of up to 70 miles per hour, the utility said. Once power is turned off, it cannot be restored until winds subside, allowing PG&E to inspect equipment for damage and make any repairs, it said. “We’re telling customers to be prepared for an outage that could last several days,” PG&E spokeswoman Tamar Sarkissian told Reuters. PG&E has come under increased scrutiny in recent years over maintenance of transmission wires and other equipment implicated in a number of major wildfires.     In May, state fire investigators determined that PG&E transmission lines caused the deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record in California, the wind-driven Camp Fire that killed 85 people in and around the town of Paradise last year. Cal Fire likewise concluded that PG&E power lines had sparked a separate flurry of wildfires that swept California’s wine country north of San Francisco Bay in 2017. PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from the North Bay and Camp Fires. RED-FLAG WARNING The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said “red-flag” warnings were posted across the entire state for what was shaping up to be the strongest wind event so far this season. The scope of the planned outage, extending to over half of California’s 58 counties, will far exceed the very first public safety power shutoff declared by PG&E in October of last year, which impacted 60,000 customers, Sarkissian said. Some consumer advocates have objected to the precautionary disruptions, saying they can harm people who need electricity for medical equipment. But PG&E promised to open community centers in 30 locations across the latest planned outage zone to furnish restrooms, bottled water, battery charging and air-conditioned seating during daytime hours. Sarkissian said PG&E had placed 45 helicopter crews and 700 extra ground personnel on standby for inspections and repairs once the latest wind event is over. Some equipment locations will require workers to hike into remote or mountainous areas for lack of vehicle access, she said.

21,UAW union pushes GM to boost U.S. auto production,"The United Auto Workers (UAW) union’s top negotiator in talks with General Motors Co (GM) to resolve a more than three-week strike said late Tuesday a key issue separating the two sides is job security. FILE PHOTO: General Motors assembly workers picket outside the General Motors Bowling Green plant during the United Auto Workers (UAW) national strike in Bowling Green, Kentucky, U.S., September 17, 2019.  REUTERS/Bryan Woolston/File Photo“We have made it clear that there is no job security for us when GM products are made in other countries for the purpose of selling them here in the U.S.A.,” UAW Vice President Terry Dittes wrote in a letter to UAW officials on the 23th day of the strike. “We believe that the vehicles GM sells here should be built here. We don’t understand GM’s opposition to this proposition.” The strike at the United States’ biggest carmaker began on Sept. 16, with its 48,000 UAW members seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the automaker’s profit and protection of healthcare benefits. The strike has cost GM more than $1 billion and forced it to idle operations in Canada and Mexico. GM declined to comment on the UAW letter, which the union released to the media. Talks are set to resume Wednesday morning and the sides have exchanged numerous proposals since the strike began. GM’s production of trucks and sport-utility vehicles in Mexico has drawn anger among union workers. Through August, 526,000 of the 573,000 vehicles GM exported from Mexico were sent to the United States, equal to about a quarter of its U.S. sales. U.S. President Donald Trump and many lawmakers have also urged GM to build more vehicles in the United States. GM announced in November 2018 it would close four U.S. factories, including two assembly plants, and cut 15,000 jobs in North America. GM said in September before the strike began that it had offered to make $7 billion in new U.S. investments in eight facilities in four states, but did not specify timing, location or products with the exception of a planned electric truck. UAW workers are concerned that as GM shifts to more electric vehicles it will require fewer workers and that battery production may result in workers getting paid less than at existing transmission plants. Reuters has reported that GM has told the UAW it could  build a new battery plant near the now shuttered Lordstown, Ohio factory. To date, the strike has hit as many as 150,000 workers in the auto industry, a report from research and consulting firm Anderson Economic Group (AEG) showed on Tuesday. About 75,000 employees of auto parts suppliers have either been temporarily laid off or have seen their wages shrink due to the slump in demand from GM, according to the AEG report. About 5,000 workers at Michigan auto suppliers have filed for unemployment benefits as a result of the strike, the state said on Tuesday. AEG estimates that the strike has resulted in a $660 million profit hit for GM and more than $412 million in direct wage losses for all employees through the third week of the strike. Slideshow (2 Images)GM’s share price dropped by 2.5% on Tuesday as broader indexes fell. Its share price has lost 9% since the strike began, slicing more than $4 billion from the automaker’s market value. The stoppage has also led to $155 million in lost federal income and payroll tax revenue and $9.1 million in lost Michigan income tax revenue. Talks for a new four-year labor contract took a “turn for the worse” on Sunday after the UAW rejected GM’s latest offer but the two sides were still talking.

22,Protests resume in Iraq's Sadr City as uprising enters second week,"Iraq’s government issued a second package of proposed social reforms on Tuesday in an attempt to meet the demands of anti-government protesters who have demonstrated nationwide for eight days, with the loss of 110 lives and 6,000 wounded. Protesters demanding the removal of the government and a political class they view as corrupt have clashed with Iraqi security forces, mainly in the capital of Baghdad and the south. Tuesday’s 13-point plan issued by Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi centers on subsidies and housing for the poor, as well as training and educational initiatives for unemployed youth. Following a cabinet meeting, the prime minister posted his reforms on social media, although most Iraqis have been cut off from the internet and social media for several days. Protests resumed on Monday night in Baghdad’s Sadr City district, with at least one of the security forces killed, although much of Iraq appeared quieter than it has been for a week, as politicians sought a way to end the uprising. Iraqi security forces began arresting protesters after nightfall on Tuesday in eastern and northwestern parts of Baghdad, police sources told Reuters. Police carried recent photographs of protesters to identify and arrest them. Iraq’s semi-official high commission for human rights said about 500 people had been released from the 800 detained last week.  Iraq’s military said on Tuesday one member of an Interior Ministry force was killed and four wounded when they came under fire from unknown assailants in Sadr City, where 15 people died the previous night in riots. In a telephone call with Abdul Madhi, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the violence, urging the government to exercise maximum restraint and take steps to tackle protesters’ grievances, the U.S. State Department said late on Tuesday. The two officials spoke recently, it said in a statement, but did not mention the date. The violence has been the worst in Iraq since it put down an insurgency by the Sunni Muslim Islamic State group nearly two years ago, and the biggest test for Abdul Mahdi, in office for a year.  The spread of the violence to Sadr City this week could heighten the security challenge. Unrest has historically been hard to put down in the district, home to about a third of Baghdad’s 8 million people, with little electricity or water and few jobs. Protesters set fire to tires outside the municipal council building and courthouse in Mudhaffar Square, police said, adding that gunfire that targeted the security forces came from a crowd of protesters.

23,Explainer: Barr investigates the investigators of Russian meddling,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr has been traveling internationally to help investigate President Donald Trump’s complaints that his campaign was improperly targeted by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies during the 2016 presidential election. Democrats and some former law-enforcement officials say he is using the Justice Department to chase unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that could benefit Trump politically and undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.  Mueller’s investigation found that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump, and led to criminal convictions of several former campaign aides. But Mueller concluded that he did not have enough evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy with Russia. Some potential witnesses say they will not cooperate voluntarily with the Barr probe, which was announced after several congressional committees, the Justice Department’s internal watchdog and another U.S. prosecutor launched their own reviews.  That could pose problems for John Durham, the prosecutor tapped by Barr to lead the effort. WHAT IS BEING INVESTIGATED? Durham is examining whether U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies acted properly when they examined possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, which ultimately led to Mueller’s investigation. Trump and some of his political allies say U.S. officials launched the probe to undermine his chances of winning the White House, though they have provided no evidence. The effort began in July 2016, when the Australian government alerted U.S. officials that a Trump foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, had boasted to an Australian diplomat that the Russian government had material that could be damaging to Trump’s opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  Several months later, the FBI secured a court order to monitor Carter Page, a Trump campaign adviser who had traveled to Russia. Papadopoulos was later prosecuted by Mueller’s office and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Page has not been charged. WHAT IS THE FOCUS OF THE INVESTIGATION? Barr has reached out to foreign governments for cooperation. According to a source familiar with the matter, Barr and Durham traveled to Rome in September to meet with Italian intelligence officials about Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese university professor who, according to Mueller’s report, had contacts with Russian intelligence officials and told Papadopoulos that Russia had potentially damaging Clinton-related emails. Papadopoulos has claimed that Mifsud was working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and accused the Italian prime minister at the time, Matteo Renzi, of trying to undermine Trump’s 2016 campaign. Renzi said he plans to sue for defamation. U.S. Attorney General William Barr attends a Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony in honor of former Attorney General Edwin Meese in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, October 8, 2019.  REUTERS/Leah MillisBarr has also reached out to Australia, which has pledged to cooperate. He met with security agencies and government officials in the United Kingdom in July, according to sources familiar with the matter. People in Ukraine have also been sharing information, according to the Justice Department, but as of two weeks ago, Barr had not spoken with government officials there.  Several former Justice Department officials say Barr’s involvement is inappropriate. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment about the investigation. Durham’s probe seems to be moving at a more deliberate pace in Washington. While the FBI says it has been cooperating, senior figures involved in the 2016 investigation have not yet heard from Durham’s team, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Among them: former FBI general counsel James A. Baker; former CIA Director John Brennan; former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper; former FBI agent Peter Strzok; and David Laufman, a former senior Justice Department official. “There are no indications that this is an actual investigation,” said Shawn Turner, a spokesman for Clapper. Carter Page, the initial target of the surveillance, also told Reuters he had not heard from Durham’s team, but said he had been providing the Justice Department with unsolicited information. Papadopoulos declined to comment. Other key figures may not be willing to cooperate with the investigation.  Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer whose research linking Trump to Russia helped fuel the FBI’s initial investigation, does not intend to cooperate with Durham’s probe if asked, according to a source familiar with his views.  Current and former officials at the State Department also are unwilling to participate voluntarily, according to a congressional source. That could create a hurdle for Durham, who according to the New York Times, was not given the authority to subpoena witnesses.  HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM THE OTHER TWO INVESTIGATIONS? The Justice Department’s internal watchdog, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, has completed a separate, related investigation. His office is going through the process of removing classified information before it releases its findings to the public. That probe, launched in 2018, focuses on whether the FBI followed proper procedures when it asked the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for permission to monitor Page, the Trump adviser, in 2016. Slideshow (2 Images)Separately, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions in 2017 assigned Utah’s top federal prosecutor, John Huber, to review a wide range of issues that Republicans had raised, including the FBI’s conduct during investigations related to Clinton and Trump.  Huber has ceded some portions of his probe to Durham and is waiting for Horowitz to finish his review.

24,Jury says J&J must pay $8 billion in case over male breast growth linked to Risperdal,"Johnson & Johnson must pay $8 billion in punitive damages to a man who previously won $680,000 over his claims that it failed to warn that young men using its antipsychotic drug Risperdal could grow breasts, a Philadelphia jury said on Tuesday. The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas jury’s verdict in favor of Nicholas Murray came in the first case in which a Pennsylvania jury had been able to consider awarding punitive damages in one of thousands of Risperdal cases pending in the state. “This jury, as have other juries in other litigations, once again imposed punitive damages on a corporation that valued profits over safety and profits over patients,” Murray’s lawyers, Tom Kline and Jason Itkin, said in a joint statement. “Johnson & Johnson and (subsidiary) Janssen chose billions over children.” J&J said the award was “grossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award in this case, and the company is confident it will be overturned.” It added that the jury in the case had not been allowed to hear evidence of Risperdal’s benefits. Professor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law said he expects the punitive damages to be lowered on appeal, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision which found that “few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.” Tobias said the verdict was about sending a message. “A jury, if it’s outrageous enough conduct, will award a big number and let the lawyers and judges work it out,” he said. Tobias added that the verdict could be a sign that J&J will face more large damages awards in other Risperdal cases. “The kind of evidence in this trial may persuade another jury or judge to do something similar,” he said. Murray, like other male plaintiffs in the mass tort litigation over Risperdal, alleges that he developed breasts after being prescribed the medicine when he was a minor. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug in late 1993 for treating schizophrenia and episodes of bipolar mania in adults. Plaintiffs claim that J&J failed to warn of the risk of gynecomastia, the development of enlarged breasts in males, associated with Risperdal, which they say the company marketed for unapproved uses with children. In his lawsuit, Murray, now 26, alleged that he developed breasts after his doctors began prescribing him Risperdal off-label in 2003 after a psychologist diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines as they see fit, while companies are only allowed to promote their drugs for approved uses.  A jury in 2015 awarded Murray $1.75 million after finding J&J was negligent in failing to warn of the risk of gynecomastia. A state appeals court upheld the verdict in February 2018 but reduced it to $680,000. Plaintiffs in the mass tort litigation had been barred from seeking punitive damages since 2014, when a state court judge ruled that the law of New Jersey, which prohibits punitive damages and is J&J’s home state, should be applied globally to the cases. But a Pennsylvania Superior Court ruling in 2018 cleared the way for punitive damages awards, holding that the law of each plaintiff’s state should instead apply.

25,Wealthy couple gets prison terms for U.S. college admissions scam,"The founder of a food and beverage packaging company and his wife were each sentenced to one month in prison on Tuesday for their roles in what prosecutors say is the largest college admissions scam uncovered in the United States. FILE PHOTO: Marcia Abbott and her husband Gregory Abbott, the Founder and Chairman of International Dispensing Corp. facing charges in a nationwide college admissions cheating scheme, leave the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., March 29, 2019.   REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File PhotoGregory and Marcia Abbott received lighter sentences than the eight-month terms sought by federal prosecutors in Boston after they admitted to paying $125,000 to have a corrupt test proctor secretly correct their daughter’s answers on college entrance exams. The couple’s sentence by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani also includes a requirement that they each pay a $45,000 fine. They previously pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Lawyers for the Abbotts did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Abbotts are among 52 people charged with participating in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools. William “Rick” Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March to charges that he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe sports coaches at universities to present his clients’ children as fake athletic recruits. The 35 parents charged in the investigation include executives and celebrities, such as “Desperate Housewives” star Felicity Huffman and “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin. Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison on Sept. 13 after pleading guilty to engaging in the college exam cheating scheme. Loughlin has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said the Abbotts in 2018 arranged through Singer to have an associate pose as a proctor for their daughter’s ACT and SAT exams to correct her answers at a test center Singer controlled through bribery. The proctor was Mark Riddell, a former counselor at a Florida private school who pleaded guilty in April to secretly taking SAT and ACT college entrance exams in place of Singer’s clients’ children or correcting their answers. Prosecutors said the Abbotts’ goal was to improve their daughter’s prospects for gaining admission to Duke University, Marcia Abbott’s alma mater. In papers, the Abbotts’ lawyers said they were good people who made an “aberrational, terrible decision.” They argued the couple deserved a term of probation.

26,U.S. imposes visa restrictions on Chinese officials over Muslim treatment,"The United States has imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province, the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited the decision of the Commerce Department on Monday to add 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies - including video surveillance company Hikvision - to a U.S. trade blacklist over Beijing’s treatment of Uighur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. The visa restrictions “complement” the Commerce Department actions, he said. U.S. officials previously said the Trump administration was considering sanctions against officials linked to China’s crackdown on Muslims, including Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who, as a member of the powerful politburo, is in the upper echelons of China’s leadership.  The State Department announcement did not name the officials subject to the visa restrictions, but news of the action sent U.S. stocks down. Many analysts believe U.S. government actions make it much less likely that China and the United States will reach a deal this week to resolve a trade war. “The United States calls on the People’s Republic of China to immediately end its campaign of repression in Xinjiang, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease efforts to coerce members of Chinese Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to China to face an uncertain fate,” Pompeo said.  The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment. China has consistently denied any mistreatment of Uighurs.

The companies include some of China’s leading artificial intelligence firms such as SenseTime Group Ltd, and Megvii Technology Ltd, which is backed by Alibaba, as well as Hikvision, formally known as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, Zhejiang Dahua Technology, IFLYTEK Co, Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co, and Yixin Science and Technology Co.

28,Russian propaganda increased after 2016 U.S. election: Senate committee,"The Senate committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election said on Tuesday that the Kremlin’s best-known propaganda arm increased its social media activity after that vote, adding to concerns about foreign meddling in the current 2020 campaign. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) speaks with reporters after the weekly Senate Republican caucus luncheon at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., September 10, 2019.  REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstThe Senate Intelligence Committee, which has managed to operate under bipartisan consensus when other congressional panels have not, said in a report that activity by the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency “increased, rather than decreased, after Election Day 2016.” IRA-linked account activity jumped more than 200% on Instagram and more than 50% on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, the committee said. The IRA and related entities and people were indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller.  The committee, led by Republican Chairman Richard Burr and Democratic Vice Chairman Mark Warner, also concluded that African-Americans had been the group most targeted by Russian influence campaigns that sought to exacerbate tensions and increase the election prospects of President Donald Trump. “By flooding social media with false reports, conspiracy theories, and trolls, and by exploiting existing divisions, Russia is trying to breed distrust of our democratic institutions and our fellow Americans,” Burr said. He called for Congress, the executive branch and the social media companies to redouble their efforts at transparency and education. The report by the Republican-controlled committee reaffirmed findings by the U.S. intelligence community and Mueller that the Kremlin pursued an influence operation through social media and other means aimed at throwing the 2016 U.S. presidential election to Trump over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. In doing so, the Senate report contradicted allegations by Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and others that Ukraine colluded with Democrats to undermine Trump’s campaign, as well as charges by the White House and Trump allies - including Representative Devin Nunes - that Russia actually aided Clinton’s candidacy. “The Committee found that IRA social media activity was overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump, and to the detriment of Secretary Clinton’s campaign,” said the report, the latest in a series from the senators related to 2016 interference. On YouTube, all of the IRA’s political videos were thematically opposed to Clinton. Some aimed at dissuading black Americans to vote, while others suggested they vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. The report detailed an extraordinarily sophisticated operation that witnesses described as the most successful influence campaign in history, one that will be studied globally for decades. The effort went well beyond hacking, Facebook and Twitter and swept up Medium, Tumblr and Pinterest. One Facebook page with more than 200,000 followers, “Army of Jesus,” posted only pro-Christian messages until just before the election. Then it blared a false story asserting that Clinton had approved removing the word God from the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance. False and slanted stories often spread more rapidly than professional, independent news. In the key swing state of Michigan, one study found that the ratio “was most disproportionate the day before the election.”   The panel recommended that Congress consider new laws requiring disclosure of who pays for election-related online advertising. Members expressed special alarm at sophisticated micro-targeting, noting that the IRA could have been much more effective in swing states if it had used Facebook tools for customizing audiences instead of just using geography. “Propagandists will be able to continue to utilize increasingly advanced off-the-shelf capabilities to target specific individuals with highly targeted messaging campaigns,” it wrote in the detailed, 85-page report. It also said social media companies, which have come under fire for allowing propaganda to flourish, should share more information about what they find on their platforms. In the long term, the committee said, resistance to foreign manipulation will require building media literacy from an early age, perhaps with federal funding but led by state and local educational institutions.

31,Boeing 737 MAX timetable uncertain as regulators continue safety review,"U.S. and European Union regulators said on Tuesday they were still reviewing changes Boeing Co made to 737 MAX software after two fatal crashes, a development that raised questions about how quickly the grounded aircraft can return to service.  FILE PHOTO: Employees walk by the end of a 737 Max aircraft at the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, U.S., March 27, 2019. REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson/File PhotoThe ongoing safety review means a key 737 MAX certification test flight is unlikely before November, two sources said. Boeing has repeatedly said it hopes to resume flights in the fourth quarter, which began on Oct. 1. Regulators sought to play down talk of transatlantic divisions over safety changes to the 737 MAX, which was grounded worldwide in March after two crashes killed 346 people within five months. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement it has a “transparent and collaborative relationship” with other civil aviation authorities as it continues its 737 MAX safety review. Its European Union counterpart said it was in “continuous contact” with both the FAA and Boeing. “We do not at this stage have any specific concerns resulting from that assessment that would mean that we could not agree to a coordinated return to service. We are in continuous contact with both the FAA and Boeing,” a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) spokeswoman said by email. FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Reuters in September the agency would need about a month following the yet-to-be scheduled certification test flight before the planes could return to service. The FAA reiterated on Tuesday that it does not have a firm date for completing its review. Among its changes, Being is addressing a flaw discovered in the software architecture of the 737 MAX flight-control system that involves using and receiving input from both flight control computers rather than one. For decades, 737 models have used only one of the flight control computers for each flight, switching to the other computer on the following flight, Reuters reported in August. FAA still needs to see Boeing’s “final system description” - a “500-ish page document that has the architecture of the flight control system and the changes that they have made,” Dickson said last month. It then will need to complete an “integrated system safety analysis” and conduct pilot workload management scenarios. Boeing plans to revise the 737 MAX software to take input from both angle-of-attack sensors in the anti-stall system linked to the two deadly crashes and has added additional safeguards. Separately, a $50 million Boeing assistance fund that announced Sept. 23 it would pay each family $144,500 in the two deadly crashes has already paid three of the five claims submitted to date, the fund’s co-administrator, Camille Biros,  told Reuters on Monday. Southwest Airlines Co is scheduling without the MAX until at least early January, pending regulatory approval for commercial flight. American Airlines Group and United Airlines have canceled MAX flights through part of December. ",Top-Nachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
32,"Jeffrey Epstein accuser expands lawsuit against estate, alleged enablers","A New York woman who said Jeffrey Epstein began grooming her for sex when she was 14 and later raped her expanded her lawsuit against his estate, naming several women who allegedly enabled the financier’s abuses and seeking to block the estate from shielding his assets from victims. In her amended complaint filed on Tuesday, Jennifer Araoz accused four women by name who once worked with Epstein of misconduct, and added more than 20 corporate defendants associated with the late financier. Araoz, 32, wants “justice not just against Mr. Epstein’s estate, but the network of enablers that surrounded him, and the network of corporate interests that surrounded him,” her lawyer Daniel Kaiser told reporters on a conference call. “Every penny of his estate should be available to satisfy the claims of victims,” he added. Epstein, 66, died by hanging himself in his Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10, two days after signing a will and putting his estimated $577 million estate into a trust. Kaiser said it would be obvious to any judge that this was a fraudulent effort to keep his money away from victims. The four women include Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime confidante; Lesley Groff, a former secretary; Cimberly Espinosa, a former executive assistant; and Rosalyn Fontanilla, a former maid who died in October 2016.  All but Fontanilla are named as defendants. A lawyer for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Maxwell, the daughter of late British publisher Robert Maxwell, has denied involvement in Epstein’s sex trafficking. Groff’s lawyer Michael Bachner said: “At no time during Lesley’s employment with Epstein did she ever engage in any misconduct.” Neither Espinosa, nor a lawyer for the executors of Epstein’s estate, could immediately be reached for comment. Following his July 6 arrest, Epstein pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges involving dozens of underage girls at his mansions on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and in Palm Beach, Florida. He had escaped federal prosecution by pleading guilty in 2008 to Florida state prostitution charges, an agreement now widely considered too lenient. The financier once counted U.S. President Donald Trump, former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Britain’s Prince Andrew as friends. They have not been accused of criminal wrongdoing. ‘THREE GIRLS A DAY’ Araoz accused the defendants of conspiring to identify and procure a steady stream of underage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse. The defendants “participated with and assisted Epstein in maintaining and protecting his sex trafficking ring, ensuring that approximately three girls a day were made available to him for his sexual pleasure,” the amended complaint said. Araoz filed her lawsuit in a New York state lawsuit in Manhattan. Araoz, who claims she was recruited to give massages to Epstein in 2001, said Epstein did not use a condom while raping her the next year, causing a panic disorder worsened by her father’s recent death from AIDS. She also said she quit a Manhattan high school near Epstein’s home because she feared seeing him or his recruiter.

Araoz had been the first person to sue Epstein’s estate under New York’s Child Victims Act, which gave accusers a one-year window to sue over alleged sexual abuse when they were underage, regardless of when that abuse occurred. At least five other lawsuits have since been filed against Epstein’s estate. Epstein’s death ended the federal criminal case against him, but not the investigation of his alleged accomplices.

34,Cracks in Purdue's proposed opioid settlement as Arizona backs out,"The U.S. state of Arizona withdrew its support for a proposed nationwide opioid settlement with Purdue Pharma LP, saying the maker of OxyContin sought to “undermine material terms of the deal,” according to a court filing on Monday. FILE PHOTO: Bottles of prescription painkiller OxyContin, 40mg, 20mg and 15mg pills, made by Purdue Pharma L.D. sit on a counter at a local pharmacy, in Provo, Utah, U.S., April 25, 2017. REUTERS/George Frey/File PhotoSince Purdue filed for bankruptcy protection in September, Arizona is the first state to switch sides in the looming showdown over the privately-held company’s proposed settlement, which it has estimated is worth more than $10 billion.  Purdue reached the deal last month with 24 states and the local governments that have filed the bulk of the more than 2,600 lawsuits against the company. The lawsuits allege Purdue and its Sackler family owners contributed to a public health crisis by aggressively marketing opioids while downplaying their addiction and overdose risks, which contributed to nearly 400,000 deaths since 1999, according to U.S. statistics.  “Purdue and the Sackler family need to take responsibility for their role in the opioid crisis,” said Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in a statement. Purdue declined to comment. Last week, court filings from states and local governments opposing the settlement asserted that Purdue steered up to $13 billion in profits to the Sackler family, more than triple the amount previously cited in litigation.  A lawyer for some of the Sacklers last week said in a statement that much of the money was paid in taxes and reinvested in businesses that will be sold as part of the proposed settlement.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, will on Friday consider Purdue’s request for an injunction to pause the litigation for about nine months. Purdue said it needs time to try to settle the remaining cases. Purdue also asked Drain to shield the Sacklers from litigation, even though they have not filed for bankruptcy, partly because the family has proposed contributing at least $3 billion toward the settlement. Opponents of the settlement accused the family of using Purdue’s bankruptcy to shield their wealth from victims. With Arizona, 25 states now oppose the deal. Kentucky and Oklahoma reached prior settlements with Purdue. Separately on Tuesday, a Massachusetts judge ruled against the Sacklers, who sought to have the state’s lawsuit against them dismissed. The judge rejected their argument they did not personally participate in Purdue’s conduct. Massachusetts was the first state to sue the Sacklers and Attorney General Maura Healey is leading the opposition to the proposed settlement. ",Inlandsnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
35,U.S. Supreme Court divided on LGBT employment protection; Gorsuch could be key,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared closely divided over whether a landmark federal law forbidding sex discrimination in the workplace protects gay and transgender employees, with conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch emerging as a potential decisive vote. The nine justices heard two hours of high-profile arguments in three cases that could broaden LGBT rights involving three workers - two gay and one transgender - who sued after being fired by their employers, claiming unlawful discrimination. The Supreme Court has never ruled on transgender rights. The court’s four liberal justices signaled agreement toward arguments by the plaintiffs that gay and transgender workers are covered under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex as well as race, color, national origin and religion. Some of the court’s five conservative justices appeared skeptical, but Gorsuch, a conservative appointed by President Donald Trump, asked several questions indicating potential sympathy for the plaintiffs’ claims. Gorsuch suggested that sex, as defined in the law, can be a contributing factor to someone being fired based on their sexual orientation. “Sexual orientation is surely in play here. But isn’t sex also in play here?,” Gorsuch asked, adding, “And isn’t that enough?” “In what linguistic formulation would one say that sex - biological gender - has nothing to do with what happened in this case?” Gorsuch added, referring to the two fired gay plaintiffs, one from Georgia and one from New York. The third case involved a transgender plaintiff fired from a job in Michigan. Verwandte ThemenFor LGBT people outside U.S. Supreme Court, cases have a familiar ringBut Gorsuch later suggested the court would be overstepping its role if it ruled in favor of gay and transgender workers instead of letting Congress legislate on the subject, saying such it would be the type of ruling that could ignite “massive social upheaval.” “It’s a question of judicial modesty,” Gorsuch said. But liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, “At what point does the court continue to permit invidious discrimination?” At least one of the conservative justices would have to join the four liberals for the plaintiffs to prevail. Rulings in the cases are due by the end of June. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, sometimes considered the ideological center of the court, appeared concerned about religious employers facing increased liability if gay and transgender workers receive Title VII protection. Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, said that if the court decides that Title VII protects gay people it would effectively be rewriting a law enacted by Congress in a way that was never intended by the lawmakers who passed it. Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s other appointee, said little to indicate how he might vote. Justice Clarence Thomas, who missed the opening day of the court’s term on Monday with an illness, was at the arguments but asked no questions, as is his custom.

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstThe Trump administration argued that Title VII does not cover sexual orientation or gender identity. GAY MARRIAGE The Supreme Court delivered an important gay rights decision in 2015 legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Its dynamics on LGBT issues changed following the 2018 retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who backed gay rights in major cases including same-sex marriage. He was replaced by Kavanaugh. The legal fight focuses on the definition of “sex” in Title VII. The plaintiffs, along with civil rights groups and many large companies, have argued that discriminating against gay and transgender workers is inherently based on their sex and consequently is illegal. Liberal justices appeared skeptical of arguments by the Trump’s administration’s lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, and a lawyer for the employers that Title VII does not cover sexual orientation because it is a separate trait than sex.  Liberal Justice Elena Kagan said the court has always analyzed such discrimination cases in a simple way: Would it have happened if the person were a different sex? “Obviously the same thing would not have happened,” Kagan said. Hundreds of demonstrators backing LGBT rights gathered near the courthouse, holding signs reading, “Do fire Trump. Don’t fire LGBTQ workers,” “Discrimination is bad for business” and “LGBT Americans power our economy.” A small group opposing gay and transgender rights held signs including “Fear God” and “Sin and shame, not pride.” A ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would provide gay and transgender workers greater protections, especially in the 28 U.S. states that lack comprehensive measures against employment discrimination. A ruling against the plaintiffs would mean gay and transgender people in those states would have few options to challenge workplace discrimination.

37,White House says it will refuse to cooperate with impeachment inquiry,"The White House said on Tuesday it would refuse to cooperate with an “illegitimate, unconstitutional” congressional impeachment inquiry, setting Republican President Donald Trump on a collision course with the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives. Hours after the administration abruptly blocked a key witness in the Ukraine scandal from testifying to congressional panels, White House lawyer Pat Cipollone criticized the decision by lawmakers to proceed with an impeachment inquiry without a full House vote. “You have designed and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process,” he said, adding House Democrats had left Trump “no choice.” “To fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances,” he said. In the White House’s most aggressive response to the inquiry yet, the State Department had said earlier the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, a Trump political donor, would not be allowed to appear before what Trump decried as a “kangaroo court.” Democratic lawmakers denounced the effort to block testimony from Sondland, who had already flown in from Europe for the appearance, calling it an attempt to obstruct their inquiry. They issued a subpoena compelling him to appear on Oct. 16 to submit to questions. The Ukraine investigation has cast a pall over Trump’s campaign to win back the White House in 2020. A whistleblower complaint about a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, prompted the inquiry. Biden is a leading candidate among the crowded field of contenders seeking the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 election. Trump has denied he did anything wrong in the phone call. Verwandte ThemenU.S. Senate panel chairman says to probe Ukraine, invites GiulianiWhite House calls House impeachment probe unconstitutionalSee more stories The investigation could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate. Republicans who control the Senate have shown little appetite for ousting Trump. “Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in response to the White House letter. She did not indicate what steps, if any, House Democrats might take to compel Trump’s cooperation. ‘NAKED POLITICAL STRATEGY’ The White House letter spelled out Trump’s evolving strategy of stonewalling lawmakers’ demands for witnesses and documents, while questioning the legality of the inquiry. White House lawyer Cipollone described the probe as “a naked political strategy” that violated Trump’s due process rights and was designed to reverse the 2016 presidential election and influence the November 2020 election. “Your transparent rush to judgment, lack of democratically accountable authorization, and violation of basic rights in the current proceedings make clear the illegitimate, partisan purpose” of the inquiry, he said. Legal experts said the U.S. Constitution gives the House broad discretion to decide how to conduct an impeachment investigation and that the Supreme Court would not second-guess the procedures Congress adopts. “They can do the investigation in more or less any order they want,” said Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on impeachment. But Bowman added: “Politically, it would certainly seem helpful to allow some participation by presidential representatives at some points.” During the impeachment investigation of President Bill Clinton, the House adopted procedures that allowed his lawyers to respond to evidence and make requests for witness testimony.

Picture taken June 4, 2019. REUTERS/Francois LenoirOn a conference call with reporters, a senior administration official said Trump had not been given procedural protections granted in earlier impeachment proceedings, including “the ability to see evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, to have counsel present at all hearings, the ability to object to testimony and the ability to call witnesses.” Republican strategist Rick Tyler, a frequent Trump critic, said the White House letter “reads like a political press release.” “It doesn’t seem to be based on any sound legal theory,” he said. ‘OBSTRUCTING CONGRESS’ A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday found support for impeachment unchanged among all Americans -holding at 45% since last week - but rising among Democrats. Opposition to impeachment also dropped by 2 percentage points from last week to 39%. Among those who identify as Democrats, 79% said Trump should be impeached, up 5 percentage points from a similar poll that ran Sept. 26 to 30. Only 12% of Republicans and about one in three independents supported impeachment, which was mostly unchanged. Trump defended the decision not to allow Sondland to testify, writing on Twitter that he would “be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republicans’ rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public ... to see.” Democrats view Sondland as a key witness who can help shed light on whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure it to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm. Trump has alleged corruption by the Bidens, but has not provided any evidence to back that up. According to text messages between Sondland and Trump’s former envoy to Ukraine, released by House committee leaders last week, the two U.S. diplomats sought to set strict conditions for Zelenskiy meeting Trump at the White House, including Ukraine drafting a statement committing it to carrying out the investigations sought by Trump. Sondland placed a call to Trump after a top American diplomat in Ukraine expressed concern that Washington was linking the U.S. military aid to a request for an investigation that would help Trump’s political campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter.

38,Rescue by tuk tuk as snipers rain death onto Baghdad streets,"A bright yellow three-wheeled tuk tuk careens out of the rioting crowd with gunfire crackling in the air and black smoke swirling up into the horizon. Volunteers in red tabards hoist an injured protester out of the back of the cart and carry him into a waiting ambulance. It’s a chaotic rescue, Baghdad style, during a week-long uprising that has turned streets of Iraq’s capital into a battlefield. More than 110 people have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the uprising, the worst violence since the Islamic State caliphate was crushed two years ago. Reuters journalists have witnessed snipers killing and wounding protesters by firing into crowds from rooftops. Protesters say that with crowds packed tightly into the streets, ambulances either can’t reach the victims or become targets themselves for snipers. So tuk tuk drivers, who normally make their living weaving through traffic, have stepped into the breach, plunging headlong down streets to pick up people in harm. “We take the injured. There are no ambulances. The ambulance heads into the protest and never comes back,” said Karrar, the driver of the yellow tuk tuk who raced back into the crowd for another rescue. “They are killing the injured right in the ambulances. We take the injured and we take them to the hospital. Here they are shooting at us and we are peaceful protesters, no weapons and nothing.” As protesters fled teargas, another driver steered his red tuk tuk into the melee, gunfire crackling overhead. “We take the wounded, we are helping these poor protesters.

40,Phone calls with Trump: more risky venture than diplomatic boon,"Arranging a phone call with the president of the United States used to be seen as a diplomatic win. But increasingly it comes with serious risks, from transcript leaks to domestic political blowback, and advisers are growing wary. President Donald Trump's glass of Diet Coke with the presidential seal on it sits on his desk in front of his phones during an exclusive interview with Reuters journalists in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. December 11, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst The fallout from Trump’s July 25th call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is still reverberating in Kiev and has led to the opening of an impeachment inquiry in Washington. U.S. lawmakers leading the inquiry now want access to Trump’s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and some other world leaders, with the chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee citing concerns that Trump may have jeopardized national security. “People have to adjust to the fact that a phone call with Trump is not the same as a phone call with any normal leader,” said Gerard Araud, the French ambassador in Washington until last June, who helped organize a number of calls between President Emmanuel Macron and the White House. For any world leader who has spoken to Trump, the idea that verbatim transcripts could be released is a worrying prospect and likely to alter how such calls — a lifeblood of international diplomacy — play out in the future. Yet Araud suggested leaks were perhaps the least of leaders’ concerns, citing Trump’s tendency to veer into unexpected territory, destabilizing his interlocutor. “If you want to make progress on policy, that’s a real problem. Every head of state and government has had to adjust to this non-dialogue,” he said. “Everything has been blown out of the water.” GREATER CARE The warning signs were arguably there from the beginning.  A few days after Trump took office in January 2017, he held a call with then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. At one point in the testy exchange Trump told Turnbull “You’re worse than I am”, and complained that a U.S. migration deal with Australia “shows me to be a dope”.  The transcript was leaked to the Washington Post and caused Turnbull, who stood up to Trump during the call, problems at home for his staunch anti-immigration line. Last week, the U.S. Justice Department confirmed Trump had held calls with leaders other than Zelenskiy to ask them to help Attorney General William Barr with his wide-ranging inquiry into the origins of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election. The leaders were not named, but Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed he had spoken to Trump about it. The British government said Trump spoke to Prime Minister Boris Johnson the day after Trump and Zelenskiy spoke, listing unrelated themes. A phone call with U.S. president used to be like hitting the jackpot for world leaders but Trump had turned that idea on its head, said Jonathan Eyal, the international director of the Royal United Services Institute. “Getting the president on the phone is very risky. It is very difficult to avoid these calls, but there will be a greater care among heads of government now in what they say to Trump.” NOT SO GOOD TO TALK Calls between leaders involve hours of preparation and briefing beforehand, with advisers drawing up introductory remarks, talking points, responses to challenging issues that might crop up and specific policies where cooperation is sought. A number of people will be listening in, some taking minutes and producing a transcript that is circulated to relevant government departments so that action can be taken afterwards. A former prime minister of an EU country said if he were talking to Trump now, he would be extremely wary of straying off topic, even if that meant failing to strike up a good rapport with Trump, who tends to look for common ground — like talking about golf — and uses very familiar language. “Of course you want to have good relations with the president of the United States, but in the current environment you would want to stick to the script and keep it very dry,” the former leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid coloring his country’s ties with the United States. A senior diplomat who often plans and listens on calls between his prime minister and other world leaders said leaks were always a concern, but partisan politics is a new risk. “These are important set-piece events — you want to get the call right, make your points and progress the relationship,” the official said. “That’s become harder (with Trump). It’s less predictable. Your careful planning can be thrown off course with an unexpected remark.” He said those talking to Trump needed to be businesslike and “just the facts”, avoiding exchanges like Zelenskiy’s, in which the Ukrainian at times comes across as almost fawning. Araud underscored that point, saying he had advised Macron to avoid responding to Trump’s provocations. “My advice to Macron, on Twitter at least, was not to react, because Trump will double down and you will lose.” Britain’s relations with the United States are still affected by the leak to a British newspaper in July of a cable highly critical of Trump written by Kim Darroch, the former British ambassador to Washington.

REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File PhotoTrump responded by calling Darroch “wacky” and “very stupid” on Twitter. The ambassador resigned days later. “Diplomats can’t really do their job if there is a significant risk of their honest, unfiltered judgments being leaked to the media,” said Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to Washington and Paris. “Diplomats need to know that this has not become the new normal.” ",Politik,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters

REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File PhotoBiden’s plan comes as the former vice president is seeking to hold on to his lead among black Democratic voters in the contest for the party’s nomination to run against Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election. At historically black and minority-serving institutions, Biden has promised to invest in research incubators, new labs and facilities and other infrastructure. Of the $70 billion he has pledged to spend to help the schools, about $10 billion would be spent to help them increase enrollment and graduation rates. Some $5 billion would be to help the schools fund teaching, healthcare and so-called STEM programs, which emphasize science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  Biden would also expand federal college awards known as Pell Grants, making them more generous, his campaign said. At the community-college level, Biden would not only help defray the cost of tuition, already provided free in some jurisdictions, but direct federal funds to pay for outside expenses that can make attending college too expensive, including food, lodging and childcare, his campaign said. For students struggling to pay loans for undergraduate and graduate degrees, Biden would offer $10,000 of student debt relief for every year of national or community service, up to five years. His plan would also limit the monthly loan payments due after graduation and let students discharge private student loans in bankruptcy, relief not allowed under current rules. Biden would also expand funding for training that does not involve a four-year degree, vowing to spend $50 million on workforce training programs including community-college business partnerships and apprenticeships. Among the 19 candidates seeking the Democratic nomination, Biden has been a front-runner for months. But U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has caught up or edged past him in some recent polls - in part because of an increase in support among black voters. Warren has promised to spend $50 billion to help historically black colleges and universities, while Senator Kamala Harris, who is black, says she will commit $60 billion for the schools.

42,"Democrats subpoena Pentagon, White House budget office in impeachment probe","Congressional Democrats issued subpoenas to the Pentagon and the White House budget office on Monday as part of their impeachment inquiry, seeking documents related to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withhold military assistance from Ukraine. The subpoenas follow a whistleblower’s allegations that Trump leveraged $400 million in aid to secure a promise from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate political rival Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The taxpayer funds had been approved by Congress to help Ukraine protect against Russian aggression. “The committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding military assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression, as well as any efforts to cover up these matters,” according to a statement from three House of Representatives panels leading the inquiry. Biden is a leading contender in the Democratic race to face Trump as he seeks re-election in November 2020. The Department of Defense and the White Office of Management and Budget must turn over the documents by Oct. 15, they said.

The new subpoenas follow those issued to the State Department and White House in recent weeks by the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees. Democrats also have called a number of U.S. diplomats to Capitol Hill for closed-door testimony this week as they build their impeachment case against Trump, while the White House considers ways to slow down the process. Trump has denied he did anything wrong in the July 25 call  in which he asked Zelenskiy to work with his personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to look into the Bidens. The White House released a summary of the call. “The impeachment inquiry is a scam,” Trump said on Monday at the White House. Those scheduled to testify this week include Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who was involved in efforts to get Ukraine to open the Biden investigation, and Masha Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May after Trump supporters questioned her loyalty to the president.

A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate. Few Republicans have broken ranks with Trump so far over his asking Ukraine and China to launch investigations of Biden, a former vice president.  SECOND WHISTLEBLOWER On Sunday, lawyers said a second whistleblower had come forward to substantiate an August complaint from an unidentified  U.S. intelligence official that touched off the investigation.  Diplomatic text messages released by Democrats last week show that U.S. officials were involved in the effort to secure a public commitment from Ukraine to look into the business dealings of Hunter Biden. Trump has alleged that Hunter Biden profited in his business dealings in both Ukraine and China from his father’s position, and that Joe Biden, as vice president, pushed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to impede a probe of a company tied to his son. However, the prosecutor in question was widely regarded by Washington and its European allies as being too lax in his investigations. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either Biden.

43,Exclusive: Kim Kardashian praises climate activist Thunberg and hopes for meeting,"US reality TV star Kim Kardashian heaped praise on Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg on Tuesday, calling her a “brave and amazing young woman” and said she shared her concerns about climate change. Kardashian, 38, said she would love to have dinner with Thunberg, who told world leaders at the opening of a United Nations conference last month that they had stolen her childhood with “empty words.” “She (Thunberg) is such an amazing young girl, and so brave and courageous to stand up to these grown-ups that can be very scary and for her to be so open and honest is exactly what we need,” Kardashian told Reuters in an exclusive interview during a visit to Armenia. “Climate change is a serious problem,” said Kardashian, who was attending the World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT) in the Armenian capital Yerevan. She said she also wanted to talk to Thunberg’s parents and to share her thoughts as a social media entrepreneur. “Speaking on a big platform invites a lot of different opinions and personalities and how they (parents) manage that,” Kardashian said. Kardashian’s ancestors came from Armenia and her visit also included seeing three of her four children baptized on Monday in the country’s main cathedral Echmiadzin.

Kardashian said that all members of her family were very cautious about the environment and she defended other famous people like Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, who have been criticized for using private jets. They were “very passionate about decisions that change the world,” Kardashian said of the royal couple. “I still love and value the fact that they bring such attention to such important movements that need to happen and they are really passionate about, because they are still changing the world,” she said. Talking about plans for her businesses, which include beauty products and shapewear, Kardashian said she was considering opening a factory and investing in Armenia, which her ancestors left for the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. “I’m excited as tonight I have a meeting and I’m gonna talk about future investments and opening up a factory here and how to really bring this (business) to Armenia,” Kardashian said about her plans in the ex-Soviet country. Kardashian, who has over 60 million followers on Twitter, said she was very determined to complete her studies as a lawyer, although it was “challenging for her” due to her tight schedule. She wants to promote the hiring of ex-prisoners so they are able to return to the workforce.

45,"Ahead of offensive, Turkey says it strikes Syria-Iraq border","Turkey’s military struck the Syrian-Iraqi border to prevent Kurdish forces using the route to reinforce northeast Syria, as Ankara prepared to attack following a surprise U.S. troop pullback, Turkish officials told Reuters on Tuesday. Turkey says it is ready to advance into northeast Syria now that the United States has begun withdrawing troops from the Turkey-Syria frontier in an abrupt policy shift by U.S. President Donald Trump widely criticized in Washington as a betrayal of America’s allies, the Kurds. As Turkish troops finalize plans, the government’s scheme to move millions of refugees into conquered territory in northeast Syria is alarming some Western allies as much as the military operation itself. For Turkey, which views Kurdish YPG fighters in northeast Syria as terrorists because of their ties to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey, an influx of non-Kurdish Syrians would help it secure a buffer against its main security threat. The U.S. move will leave Kurdish-led forces long allied to Washington vulnerable to attack by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK). Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will visit the United States on Nov. 13 at Trump’s invitation, a White House spokesman said. On Monday, Erdogan said U.S. troops had started to withdraw after a phone call he had with Trump, adding that talks between Turkish and U.S. officials on the matter would continue. On Tuesday, a U.S. official said U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley took part in the phone call, but the official did not provide further details. “Given the likely military issues raised on the call between (Trump) and President Erdogan, Secretary of Defense Esper and Chairman Milley participated on the call,” said the official. Verwandte ThemenErdogan's aide says Turkey to start Syria offensive 'shortly'We weren't warned about U.S. plan to pull troops from Syria northeast: KremlinSee more stories Earlier, the Pentagon said Esper and Milley had been consulted by Trump “over the last several days” about a possible Turkish strike in Syria. “Unfortunately, Turkey has chosen to act unilaterally. As a result we have moved the U.S. forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety,” U.S. Defense Department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement. OVERNIGHT STRIKE A Turkish security official said one of the main goals of the overnight strike was to cut off a transit route between Iraq and Syria often used by Kurdish armed groups “before the operation in Syria”. It was unclear what damage was done or whether there were casualties. Details of the strike, a joint operation by Turkey’s intelligence service and the military, were hazy. One official described them as an air strike, while the other said the site was made “unusable through various means”.  Trump denied he had abandoned the Kurdish forces, the most effective U.S. partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria. But he praised Turkey as a trade partner, in a softening of tone hours after threatening to “totally destroy” Turkey’s economy if it acted “off limits” in Syria. Amid deepening humanitarian concerns, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties in northeast Syria to exercise maximum restraint and protect civilians. Signaling a further potential shift in the region’s power balance, the Kurdish-led forces said they might start talks with the Syrian government and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full U.S. withdrawal. Turkey sought to underscore its determination to act. “The TSK will never tolerate the establishment of a terror corridor on our borders. All preparations for the operation have been completed,” the Turkish Defense Ministry said.  Turkish army howitzers are positioned on the Turkish-Syrian border, near the southeastern town of Akcakale in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 7, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer ROCKET SYSTEMS Near the Turkish border town of Akcakale, across from Syria’s Tel Abyad, a Reuters witness saw howitzers placed behind earth embankments on Turkey’s side of the border, pointed toward Syria. Some 60 km (40 miles) to the west, multiple launch rocket systems mounted on two trucks were deployed behind earth embankments near Suruc, opposite the Syrian border town of Kobani. Artillery was also stationed in the area, and soldiers wandered around a nearby military camp. Trump’s warning on Turkey’s economy on Monday appeared aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds. Democrats criticized his withdrawal decision, as did some  of his fellow Republicans in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.      His remarks, reiterated on Tuesday in slightly modified form, met an angry response in Turkey, including from opposition party politicians such as Iyi Party leader Meral Aksener. “Threatening Turkey’s economy is a diplomatic catastrophe,” she told her party’s lawmakers in a speech in parliament. “The best response to this insolence is to go into the east of the Euphrates and break the terror corridor.” But on Tuesday, Trump tweeted: “So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States ... They have been good to deal with.” The Kurdish-led forces have denounced the major U.S. policy shift as a “stab in the back”. Mustafa Bali of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the Turkish military buildup on the border, together with information about further mobilization of Turkey-backed Syrian rebels, indicated that “an attack is imminent”.  Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northeast Syria has rattled allies, including France, one of Washington’s main partners in the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.

European governing body UEFA’s three-step protocol for racism can lead to the referee abandoning a match if warnings to the crowd do not stop the fans racially abusing the players. “(The meeting) was just about, if it does happen, which unfortunately it does sometimes, what we need to do and what the protocol is,” Abraham’s Chelsea team mate and new squad member Fikayo Tomori was quoted as saying by Sky Sports. “He just briefed us about what was going to happen. We should be prepared for that because we know that sometimes you can go to countries and stuff like that can happen unfortunately. “We are just there to play the game and whatever happens in the stands, we’ll just let the authorities deal with that.” UEFA ordered the partial closure of Bulgaria’s national stadium after racist behavior by their fans in Euro 2020 qualifiers with the Czechs and Kosovo in June. England top the group with 12 points and will qualify for next year’s finals if they beat the second-placed Czechs. ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
48,U.S. visa move against China casts pall over talks to end trade war,"The United States on Tuesday imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities, angering Beijing, but a U.S. official said high-level trade talks would still take place on Thursday and Friday as planned. The State Department announced the visa plan just a day after the U.S. Commerce Department cited the mistreatment of Uighur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in China in its decision to add 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies to a trade blacklist. The State Department did not name the Chinese officials affected by the visa clampdown. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the restrictions “complement” the Commerce Department’s actions. China’s embassy in Washington denounced the move as “made-up pretexts” for interfering in China’s internal affairs. “#Xinjiang affairs are purely China’s internal affairs that allow no foreign interference. We urge the US to correct its mistakes at once and stop its interference in China’s internal affairs,” the embassy said on Twitter. Major U.S. stock indexes added to losses after the State Department's announcement, with the S&P 500 index .SPX closing down about 1.6%. Investors feared the escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing could doom efforts to get the trade negotiations back on track. TALKS STILL ON  The U.S. moves cast a pall over U.S.-China trade talks in Washington, where deputy negotiators met for a second day to prepare for the first minister-level meetings in more than two months on Thursday and Friday.  Verwandte ThemenChina urges U.S. to remove sanctions on Chinese firmsA spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said that no meetings were scheduled for Wednesday, but that high-level talks involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would take place as planned on Thursday and Friday. A Chinese diplomat told Reuters that China wanted a deal, but it cannot be a “zero-sum game.” The diplomat added that it was important for the United States to accept the differences between the two countries’ economic systems, particularly China’s state-led development model. China needed to protect its sovereignty and right to develop its economy, added the diplomat, who is not directly involved in the trade talks. China was motivated to improve intellectual property protections, as this was in its interests, but he said U.S. allegations of IP theft by China were unfair. Prospects for a breakthrough in the on-again, off-again trade talks sagged after the Commerce Department’s blacklisting announcement on Monday. Hikvision (002415.SZ), which bills itself as the world’s largest maker of video surveillance gear, was among the firms targeted. The listing bars the firms from buying components from American companies without U.S. government approval, a potentially crippling move. It follows the same blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for what it says are national security reasons. Washington is also moving ahead with discussions around possible restrictions on capital flows into China, with a focus on investments made by U.S. government pension funds, Bloomberg reported.  Tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the United States and China have roiled financial markets and slowed capital investment and trade flows.  International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva issued a stark warning about the state of the global economy, saying an economic deceleration could worsen without action to resolve trade conflicts and support growth.

Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo/File Photo“We are decelerating, we are not stopping, and it’s not that bad. And yet, unless we act now, we are risking a potential more massive slowdown,” Georgieva, who took over as IMF chief this month, said at an event to preview the IMF and World Bank autumn meetings next week in Washington. LOOMING TARIFF HIKES The trade talks in Washington are taking place days before U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods are slated to rise to 30% from 25%. President Donald Trump has said the hike will take effect on Oct. 15 if no progress is made in the negotiations. Trump, who has embraced protectionist policies as part of an “America First” agenda aimed at rebalancing global trade and boosting U.S. manufacturing, said on Monday a quick trade deal with China was unlikely, and that he would not be satisfied with a partial agreement. The two sides have been at loggerheads over U.S. demands that China improve protections of American intellectual property, end cyber theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms, curb industrial subsidies and increase U.S. companies’ access to largely closed Chinese markets. Trump launched a new round of tariffs after the last high-level talks in late July failed to result in Chinese agricultural purchases or yield progress on substantive issues. China quickly responded with tariff increases of its own.  With no signs of any significant momentum in the talks, the world’s two largest economies could be braced for an open-ended trade dispute, an idea that is gaining currency in some circles. “I can feel that Chinese society has low expectation for real breakthrough in the new round of trade talks. Most people think alternate trade war/trade talks will be a normal thing between China&the US,” Hu Xijin, the editor of China’s state-run Global Times newspaper, wrote on Twitter. Another flashpoint in U.S.-China relations erupted over the weekend when an official with the NBA’s Houston Rockets wrote a tweet in support of Hong Kong democracy protests. The tweet, which was quickly deleted, sparked a backlash in China and a rebuke from the National Basketball Association, which in turn faced U.S. criticism that it was allowing free speech to be censored for commercial reasons. Police in Hong Kong have used rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against pro-democracy demonstrators in the former British colony, which has been plunged into its worst political crisis in decades.

54,Trump campaign touts Republican rule changes aimed at unified 2020 convention,"President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign detailed on Monday efforts to change Republican Party rules across the country to reduce the potential for opposition to the president at the 2020 nominating convention.     Three Trump campaign senior officials told reporters on a call on Monday they have worked with state parties to make it harder for Republican primary opponents to influence the selection of the delegates to the convention Trump, who enjoys strong popularity in public opinion polls within his own party, is facing three primary opponents, all of whom have struggled to gain traction.     The Republican Party will hold its official nominating convention in Charlotte in August 2020. Convention delegates - who officially select the nominee - are chosen by states and in modern times reflect the primary vote taken in each state.  While a small convention rebellion would be unlikely to dislodge Trump as the Republican nominee, the optics could be damaging for Trump, who likes to tout his broad support within his party.      “The rules of the party now reflect adequately that the will of the voters in the president’s party. This is not being done from a position of weakness,” one of the senior campaign officials said. The campaign officials could not be named as part of an agreement to listen to the call. In some states, the primary vote has been canceled entirely and party officials will select pro-Trump delegates. In other states, new rules backed by Trump’s campaign will make it harder for primary opponents who garner a small percentage of the vote to influence delegate selection.  The campaign appears to be working to ensure there is not a repeat of the 2016 convention, where Trump was nominated in Cleveland. His campaign put minimal effort into influencing delegate selection and at times, opposition to his victory in the Republican primary was vocalized by delegates on the convention floor. We “care about who is seated in all the chairs on the convention floor in Charlotte next year. We care about that because we care about ensuring a predetermined outcome in Charlotte.” The announcement comes as Trump faces intense criticism and scrutiny for a July phone call in which he asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his family. House Democrats have opened an impeachment inquiry into the president’s actions after learning about the call from a whistleblower. ",Politik,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters

GLOBAL GROWTH CONCERNS The U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened, driven by a falling two-year yield after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell flagged openness to further rate cuts and said the Fed would expand its balance sheet to ensure money markets function smoothly. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 1.534%, from 1.553% late on Monday. Markets have been waiting for the Fed to put in place policies to avoid the sort of reserve shortages that occurred recently and could disrupt the Fed’s policy goals if they were to become a regular feature of financial markets. Despite expectations for lower rates, the U.S. dollar rose against a basket of six peers. The dollar index rose 0.17%, with the euro down 0.15% to $1.0953.     Sterling tumbled after reports that Brexit talks between Britain and Brussels were close to breaking down. The EU accused Britain of playing a “stupid blame game” after a Downing Street source said a deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands. Sterling last traded at $1.2212, down 0.63% on the day. [GBP/] The safe-haven yen strengthened 0.21% versus the greenback at 107.08 per dollar. The Turkish lira gained 0.06% versus the U.S. dollar at 5.83 after falling more than 2% on Monday. Meanwhile in Washington, the new IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said trade tensions could mean a loss of around $700 billion to the world economy by 2020, or about 0.8%of global GDP. Worries over the health of the world economy sent oil prices lower even as anti-government protests resumed overnight in Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer. U.S. crude fell 0.34% to $52.57 per barrel and Brent was last at $58.17, down 0.31% on the day. “The market’s focus remains on trade tensions and oil demand concerns, ignoring the elevated geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and lower OPEC production in September,” said UBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo. “Growing recession risks have capped the upside of oil prices.” The U.S. Energy Information Administration cut its 2020 world oil demand growth forecast by 100,000 barrels per day to 1.30 million bpd, or about 7%.  Spot gold added 0.8% to $1,505.47 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.02% to $1,497.20 an ounce. Copper lost 0.67% to $5,683.50 a tonne. ",Top-Nachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
56,Indexes tumble as visa restrictions fuel U.S.-China worries,"U.S. stocks ended down sharply and near the day’s lows on Tuesday as news that the United States has imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials overshadowed comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggesting openness to further interest rate cuts. Stocks cut losses following Powell’s remarks but quickly reversed course to fall further in late trading after the U.S. State Department said it has imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province. The move stoked tensions ahead of high-level trade talks in Washington this week and added to the day’s bearishness. Earlier, the U.S. government widened its trade blacklist to include some of China’s top artificial intelligence start-ups. “The market was down because the headlines were negative coming into the U.S.-China negotiations. With Powell not changing the narrative, it makes sense that on further signs of deterioration in trade that the market would sell off,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. Losses were broad-based, led by a 2% drop in the interest-rate sensitive S&P 500 financial index .SPSY, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX dropped 3.1%.  A Bloomberg report said that Washington was moving ahead with efforts to limit capital flows to China, while a South China Morning Post report said China had toned down expectations ahead of the talks in Washington. In his remarks, Powell also said the time has come to allow the Fed’s asset holdings to begin to expand again, and that the Fed would “soon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 313.98 points, or 1.19%, to 26,164.04, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 45.73 points, or 1.56%, to 2,893.06 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 132.52 points, or 1.67%, to 7,823.78. “The overall tone from the Fed is showing a little more concern,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. Market expectations have increased that the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point in October, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Those bets were bolstered on Tuesday by data that showed U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in September.

57,"U.S. Senate panel chairman says to probe Ukraine, invites Giuliani","The Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday opened the door to a Senate investigation into unproven allegations regarding Ukraine raised by President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, inviting the attorney to testify. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) holds a news conference to discuss immigration legislation and the U.S.-Mexico border on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 15, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst“It is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,” Senator Lindsey Graham said in a series of tweets, mentioning specifically the firing of Ukraine’s former prosecutor Viktor Shokin. “Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns,” he said.  Democrats, eager for the chance to grill Giuliani, lost no time welcoming Graham’s move and called for the Trump lawyer to testify under oath.  “Good. I have questions,” Senator Kamala Harris, a Senate Judiciary member and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, tweeted to Graham. Two other Democratic presidential hopefuls also sit on the committee: Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the panel’s top Democrat, said Giuliani’s appearance would give Democrats an opportunity to “separate fact from fiction.”  Giuliani and his unsubstantiated allegations are central to the Democratic impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives, which followed a July 25 phone call in which President Donald Trump pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, did not give specific dates for a potential Giuliani appearance or any other public hearings on the matter.  A former New York City mayor, Giuliani said he would like to appear before the Senate panel but needed to determine whether maintaining confidentiality as Trump’s lawyer would be an issue. The House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the impeachment probe, has subpoenaed Giuliani to provide documents. He and others have made unsubstantiated claims that when Joe Biden was vice president, he had a prosecutor fired to halt an investigation into a Ukrainian gas company that Hunter Biden was involved in between 2014 and 2018. Biden has dismissed the allegations and no evidence has emerged to support them. ",Politik,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
58,Pro-impeachment group targets vulnerable House Republicans with new ads,"A group pushing for President Donald Trump’s impeachment will launch a six-figure digital ad campaign on Tuesday, targeting vulnerable Republicans in the House of Representatives at a time polls show a growing percentage of Americans favor impeachment. A screenshot from a digital ad from the organization ""Need to Impeach"", a group pushing for the impeachment of President Donald Trump is seen. Handout via REUTERS    Need to Impeach, a group funded mainly by billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, has already spent millions of dollars convincing Democrats to impeach Trump.  The organization is turning its attention to Republicans facing tough re-election battles next year. The group announced last week it was launching a $3.1 million ad campaign targeting incumbent Republican senators, including Cory Gardner of Colorado and Joni Ernst of Iowa.  Leaders of the group told Reuters they will extend that campaign, spending an initial $500,000 on digital media ads focused on 10 Republicans in the most competitive House districts, including Representatives Pete King of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick in Pennsylvania.  “We are going to run ads questioning their patriotism. What we have learned is that when a few people come out for impeachment, then a lot of people follow,” said Kevin Mack, the organization’s lead strategist. The ads, seen by Reuters, ask Republicans to put “Country over Party.” Other House Republican targets are John Katko and Lee Zeldin of New York; Rodney Davis of Illinois; Don Bacon of Nebraska; Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington; Scott Perry of Pennsylvania; and Michael McCaul and Chip Roy of Texas. “Based on everything I have seen and heard, I am strongly opposed to impeachment - as I was opposed to Bill Clinton’s impeachment. The digital ads will have no effect on my vote or influence my position,” King said in an emailed statement.  Katie Vincentz, a spokesperson for Zeldin, said, “Radical Democrats have an unlimited supply of dark money for their frequent lies and nasty attacks, but once again that will be money poorly spent by the left on another well-deserved loss next year.” House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower alleged that Trump used U.S. military aid to pressure Ukraine’s president to investigate Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and Biden’s son Hunter. Republicans targeted by the ads have either supported the inquiry but not impeachment, or criticized Democrats for getting ahead of the facts. Need to Impeach will also spend money thanking a group of eight Democratic House members in competitive districts for supporting impeachment. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. His re-election campaign has stepped up its digital advertising, spending $1.4 million on thousands of digital ads designed to reach voters in every state as the inquiry unfolded, according to data analyzed by Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering.  A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sept. 24 found 37% of Americans thought Trump should be impeached and 45% said he should not. A week later, the percentage favoring impeachment rose to 45% in the poll, with opponents of impeachment down to 41%. Reporting By Jarrett Renshaw; ",Politik,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters

62,'South Park' creators offer mocking 'apology' to China over episode,"The creators of satirical animated series “South Park” issued a mocking “apology” to China after media reports that episodes of the show were no longer available on some Chinese websites. The “Band in China” episode released on Oct. 2 critiqued China’s policies on free speech as well as the efforts of Hollywood to shape its movie and television content in recent years to avoid angering censors in the vast Chinese market. “Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom,” Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the irreverent Comedy Central show, wrote in a Twitter post titled “Official apology to China.” “Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn’s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?,” Parker and Stone added. A Reuters search online showed that iQiyi and Youku Tudou, two Chinese video streaming sites, both listed episodes of South Park available to view, but the actual episodes did not play when requested. Searching for the show’s name on Baidu Tieba, a popular online forum, and on Douban, a popular movie ratings site, did not yield any results. Spokespersons for Youku Tudou, iQiyi and Baidu did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which oversees internet governance, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The South Park statement followed an uproar in China and the United States over a weekend tweet, which was quickly withdrawn, by the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team that backed democracy protests in Hong Kong. The National Basketball Association (NBA) has built a large following and burgeoning business in China. The long-running “South Park” series is one of cable channel Comedy Central’s biggest and most controversial hits, built around the misadventures of four foul-mouthed fourth graders. Slideshow (3 Images)The episode at the center of the latest dispute saw character Randy Marsh being arrested after trying to smuggle marijuana into China.  In jail, he meets two Chinese prisoners called Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, and is subjected to slave labor and re-education. China has in the past proved sensitive about the British  children’s characters because Pooh is sometimes used as a nickname on social media for Chinese President Xi Jinping.

63,Yovanovitch is latest casualty of Trump war on career diplomats,"The treatment of U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch - disparaged by President Donald Trump and abruptly recalled from Ukraine - exemplifies what current and former U.S. officials describe as a campaign by Trump against career diplomats. A veteran diplomat who has led the U.S. embassies in Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine, Yovanovitch’s stint as ambassador in Kiev was cut short when she was recalled to Washington in May as Trump allies leveled unsubstantiated charges of disloyalty and other allegations against her. Former Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns, a career foreign service officer who served in top diplomatic posts under Republican and Democratic presidents, described her treatment as part of a wider “campaign within and against the department.” “There is a quite reckless and dangerous effort underway not only to sideline career expertise but to sideline the department as an institution,” said Burns, author of “The Back Channel,” a memoir of his career that calls for a renewal of U.S. diplomacy. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Attempts to reach Yovanovitch and other State Department officials also went unanswered. Yovanovitch is now embroiled in the Democratic-led House of Representatives’ inquiry into whether Trump should be impeached for pressing his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate unsubstantiated corruption charges against Democratic political rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son, Hunter. Both Bidens deny any wrongdoing. She has agreed to give a deposition to congressional committees on Oct. 11. Trump has denied pressuring Zelenskiy and defended his request to the Ukrainian president. On Sunday, he wrote on Twitter that as president he has “an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probable, CORRUPTION!” Ukrainian prosecutors have said they will review 15 old probes related to a gas company where Hunter Biden once served on the board, but added that they are unaware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Biden’s son.   Described by colleagues as a consummate professional, Yovanovitch in March became the target of allegations - vehemently denied by the State Department - that she gave a Ukrainian prosecutor a list of people not to prosecute. Trump allies called for her removal, accusing her of criticizing the president to foreign officials, something current and former colleagues found inconceivable. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, alleged that she blocked efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Trump himself, according to a White House summary, described her as “bad news” to Zelenskiy in a July 25 call in which he sought Zelinskiy’s help to investigate Biden and his son. “She’s going to go through some things,” Trump added. “There is the particularly pernicious practice of going after individual career officers, either because they worked on controversial issues in the last administration, or as in the case of Masha Yovanovitch, a terrific apolitical career diplomat who was doing her job extraordinarily well, were attacked, deeply unfairly, for political reasons,” Burns said. “We have career people who did their jobs, followed their instructions, served their country loyally, and they are being treated as pawns in a political struggle,” said a senior U.S diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. Pompeo has tried to improve morale at the State Department. Last year, he nearly doubled promotions of top American diplomats as he sought to restore ties with a workforce alienated by his predecessor, Rex Tillerson. However, current and former officials say Trump’s push to marginalize career diplomats can be seen in his proposed roughly 30% State Department budget cuts, his appointment of the highest proportion of political ambassadors in modern history and his drastic reduction in the number of career officials with confirmed posts as assistant secretaries of state and higher. As a result, there are fewer top jobs in Washington or abroad available for the most senior U.S. diplomats.  The proposed budget cuts have not been enacted because Congress has refused to pass them. The State Department has been whipsawed by major policy decisions abruptly announced by Trump over Twitter. These include a 2018 suspension of security aid to Pakistan and a breakoff of talks in September with the Taliban on a U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Louise Yovanovitch is seen during a ceremony to mark World AIDS Day in Kiev, Ukraine December 1, 2017. REUTERS/Gleb GaranichIt also has been shaken by high-profile investigations by the department inspector general and Congress into allegations of retaliation and other mistreatment of career officials by political appointees. “My impression is that the president does not respect diplomats or diplomacy at all and this translates to many of his political appointees in the Department of State,” said Richard Armitage, a veteran Republican foreign policy expert who served as deputy secretary of state under Republican George W. Bush. Asked why so many senior State Department positions are held by “acting” assistant secretaries, Armitage replied: “Because they don’t care about personnel. They don’t care about policy. They only care about the care and feeding of Donald J. Trump.” ",Politik,2019-10-06 00:00:00,Reuters
64,Democrat Buttigieg floats plan to slash rising drug costs,"Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg unveiled his plan on Monday to slash prescription drug costs for senior citizens and target pharmaceutical companies for rising prices, the latest 2020 candidate to detail policies to tackle the issue. U.S. Democratic presidential candidate and mayor of South Bend, Indiana Pete Buttigieg speaks during a forum held by gun safety organizations the Giffords group and March For Our Lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. October 2, 2019.  REUTERS/Steve MarcusButtigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said his plan would cut out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors on the Medicare government insurance program by at least 50% by the end of his first term and cap costs for out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for anyone who chooses his public insurance plan at under $250 per month. The plan would also go after pharmaceutical companies by penalizing those that raise drug prices by more than inflation, threatening to take patents away from companies that refuse to lower essential drug prices and allowing the federal government to negotiate with companies to make drugs more affordable. “Instead of siding with Americans, politicians have stood with Big Pharma, as they did when Congress barred the federal government from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies on drug prices for seniors,” said Buttigieg. “It’s time for a new era of leadership in Washington who will finally make drugs affordable and take on pharmaceutical companies.” Asked by Reuters how Buttigieg would pay for his plan, an aide said it was “cost neutral,” with between $1 billion and $2 billion of costs coming from taxes and penalties on drug companies. The aide declined to give more specifics. Democrats vying for their party’s nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election see affordable healthcare as an Achilles’ heel for Trump, whose administration has failed to push through several initiatives to lower drug prices. A federal judge in July shot down a Trump executive order that would have forced drugmakers to display list prices in advertisements, and Trump scrapped another planned order that would have banned some rebate payments that drugmakers make to payers.  DEMOCRATIC PROPOSALS Several Democratic candidates have floated plans or supported legislation to enable direct government regulation or control of prescription drug prices.   U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar announced a plan over the summer to help lower the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by seniors. [nL2N24C1ZZ] Senator Elizabeth Warren also has a Medicare pricing plan. Senator Kamala Harris in July floated a plan that would enable the government to set fair prices for prescription drugs.  Senator Bernie Sanders went to Canada in July for an event to highlight the difference in the price of insulin. [nL2N24T07O] Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic field’s front-runner, said he wanted to repeal the law that prohibits Medicare from negotiating lower prices with drug companies and limit price increases for all brand-name, biotech and “abusively priced” generic drugs to inflation. [nL2N24F089] Buttigieg’s plan would also require drug companies under a public plan or Medicare to report prices and manufacturing costs to the federal government to boost pricing transparency, reduce median annual out-of-pocket spending for drugs for those living with cancer or immune disorders and tackle the opioid epidemic by reducing the cost of naloxone - a drug used to reverse overdoses.

65,Democratic contender Bernie Sanders vows to eject money from U.S. elections,"U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday proposed overturning rules on money in elections, as the Democratic presidential contender pledged to “transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money.”  Sanders, one of 19 Democrats competing to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election, would replace the Federal Election Commission with “a true law enforcement agency” and rid party conventions and presidential inauguration ceremonies of corporate sponsorship, according to a statement from his campaign. “When we win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump, we will transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money,” the statement said. Sanders also proposed a constitutional amendment that “makes clear money is not speech and corporations are not people,” intended to undermine U.S. Supreme Court decisions that allow unrestricted spending through political action committees and tax-exempt advocacy groups. A constitutional amendment requires the support of two-thirds of both houses of the U.S. Congress and ratification by three-quarters of the states. Leading Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have opposed most efforts to restrain political donations. The proposal comes as Sanders, 78, is recovering from a health scare that forced him to cancel campaign events last week.  On Friday, his campaign said Sanders had suffered a heart attack but that he would be back on the campaign trail soon. Sanders trails former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren for the Democratic nomination in most national opinion polls.  But his campaign said last week it raised $25.3 million in mostly small donations in the third quarter of this year, outstripping all other Democrats in the 2020 race.

66,'Buckle up': Abrupt Syria policy shift is sign of Trump unchained,"Over the span of just a few hours, U.S. President Donald Trump upended his own policy on Syria with a chaotic series of pronouncements, blindsiding foreign allies, catching senior Republican supporters off guard and sending aides scrambling to control the damage. Trump’s decision on Sunday to remove some U.S. forces from northeastern Syria, opening the door to a Turkish offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, provides a vivid example of how, with traditional White House structures largely shunted aside and few aides willing to challenge him, he feels freer than ever to make foreign policy on impulse. While Trump’s erratic ways are nothing new, some people inside and outside of his administration worry that the risk of miscalculation from his seat-of-the-pants approach may only increase as he moves into re-election campaign mode facing  other unresolved, volatile international issues such as Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan. He also made clear on Monday that he was determined to make good on his 2016 campaign promise to extract the United States from “these endless wars,” although his plans for doing so are clouded by uncertainty. It comes as Trump is under growing pressure from a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry over his efforts to get Ukraine to investigate one of his political opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden. “There’s a real sense that nobody is going to stop Trump from being Trump at this stage, so everybody should buckle up,” said one U.S. national security official, who cited Trump’s firing last month of national security adviser John Bolton as a sign of the president being less restrained than ever by his top advisers. Trump’s policy whiplash on Syria started shortly after a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday in which he sought U.S. support for Ankara’s planned incursion. Several hours later, the White House issued a late-night statement - which, according to one administration official, was dictated directly by Trump to a senior aide - that said U.S. forces “will no longer be in the immediate area.” Verwandte ThemenTrump consulted with Pentagon ahead of northeast Syria troop withdrawalWhite House says Turkey's Erdogan to visit November 13See more stories This suggested that Turkey could be given free rein to strike Kurdish forces long aligned with Washington in the fight against Islamic State. Trump, in a series of Monday tweets, appeared to double down on plans for a U.S. troop drawdown if not a full withdrawal,  but later threatened to destroy the economy of NATO ally Turkey if it took its military operation too far. That seemed to be an attempt to placate criticism, including from Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, that he was  abandoning the Syrian Kurds, who denounced it as a “stab in the back.” CONFUSION AMONG TRUMP AIDES The latest presidential pronouncements on Syria injected news confusion over U.S. Syria policy. Last December, acting without a formal policymaking process, Trump called for a complete U.S. withdrawal from Syria. But he ultimately reversed himself after drawing strong pushback from the Pentagon, including the resignation of then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and an uproar on Capitol Hill and among U.S. allies in Europe and the Middle East. Trump insisted to reporters on Monday that he “consulted with everybody” on his new Syria decision, although the announcement seemed to catch Congress as well as some within his administration by surprise. “He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation,” tweeted Brett McGurk, who served as Trump’s envoy for the international coalition to combat Islamic State and quit after the December Syria policy uproar.  Trump’s abrupt decision on Syria came after learning in the phone call with Erdogan that the Turks planned to go ahead with a long-threatened incursion, a senior administration official said.  “We were not asked to remove our troops. The president when he learned about the potential Turkish invasion, knowing that we have 50 special operations troops in the region, made the decision to protect those troops” by pulling them back, the official said.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File PhotoThe official underscored that Trump’s decision did not constitute a U.S. withdrawal from Syria. Trump made clear to Erdogan that the United States did not support the Turkish military plan, which came as a surprise to the Turkish leader, a senior State Department official said. There was some confusion among senior officials trying tofigure out what Trump had actually decided, a source familiar with the internal deliberations at the White House said. But the senior administration official, speaking on a conference call with reporters, denied that Pentagon officials were “blindsided” and Trump said he had consulted with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On Tuesday, after U.S. forces began pulling back from the Turkey-Syria border, Trump was still trying to clean up after himself. In a morning tweet-storm, he denied abandoning Kurdish forces, the most effective U.S. partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria. But he also praised Turkey as a trade partner, softening the economic threats he had issued the day before. PROMISED TO BRING TROOPS HOME U.S. officials told Reuters repeatedly ahead of Trump’s decision that U.S. personnel would not be able to stay in northeast Syria if their Kurdish-led partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, were forced to turn their attention to a massive Turkish invasion. That view was reaffirmed on Monday, as officials warned that only a limited pullback was expected for now – but a larger one could follow. “If it’s wide-scale conflict, we would not have a partner in northeast Syria,” one U.S. official said on Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity. The president saw his decision in the context of fulfilling a campaign promise to ultimately bring U.S. troops home. He visited Walter Reed Medical Center on Friday and awarded Purple Heart medals to a half-dozen wounded warriors. Trump himself got into the subject earlier when taking questions from reporters at the White House. He said the United States had become a “police force” in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and he wanted to change that. Slideshow (5 Images)“I have to sign letters often to parents of young soldiers that were killed and it’s the hardest thing I have to do. I hate it,” Trump said.  Some independent analysts said, however, that Trump’s freewheeling way of making war-related decisions could further undermine U.S. credibility with allies and partners. He has already whipsawed on plans for a withdrawal from the long-running war in Afghanistan. “We find ourselves involved in counterterror operations around the world,” said Fred Hof, a former Pentagon and State Department official. “Potential partners will be looking at what happened in Syria and drawing certain conclusions.” ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters

Trump has denied any wrongdoing over Ukraine and has  reacted to the inquiry with a flurry of posts on Twitter lobbing obscenities and insulting nicknames for Democratic lawmakers, who launched their impeachment probe two weeks ago.  While the Republican-led Senate now is “unlikely” to remove Trump even if the Democratic-controlled House backs impeachment, Carter said that could change depending on what the investigation reveals. “If the facts reveal an increasing number of things that he has actually done, then of course impeachment is possible and removal from office is possible,” the nation’s oldest living former president told MSNBC.        Carter, 95, ran on a pledge of honesty and served one term in the White House from 1977 to 1981. He suffered from his own political controversies including a U.S. hostage crisis in Iran.  He criticized Trump’s response to the impeachment probe, saying blocking witnesses and documents was “stonewalling.”  “That’s a departure from custom and a departure from what the American people expect,” Carter said. “That in itself is going to be ... another item of evidence that can be used against him.” Trump, he said, should restrain himself on Twitter and “give the House of Representatives and the Senate — and the general public — the evidence that we need to form a case either for or against him.” Representatives for the other living former U.S. presidents — Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and Republican George W. Bush — could not be immediately reached for comment.  Clinton became the second U.S. president to be impeached by in 1998 but was not removed from office by the Senate. Congress took up impeachment proceedings against President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 under threat of impeachment. ",Politik,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
69,Turkey's plan to settle refugees in northeast Syria alarms allies,"As Turkish troops finalize plans to attack northeast Syria, Ankara’s scheme to move millions of refugees into conquered territory there is alarming some Western allies as much as the military operation itself. Addressing world leaders at the United Nations two weeks ago, President Tayyip Erdogan held up a map of the region setting out ambitious proposals to build dozens of new villages and towns to settle Syrian refugees.     His map showed that 1 million Syrians would be housed in the northeast, but Erdogan told the U.N. General Assembly that even more - up to 2 million - refugees could settle there once Turkish soldiers take control. For Turkey, which hosts more refugees than any other country in the world, returning some Syrians across the border has become an urgent priority as it battles economic recession and high unemployment. But most of the 3.6 million Syrians in Turkey are from Sunni Arab areas in western Syria, not the mainly Kurdish northeast. Moving huge numbers of refugees into an area hundreds of miles from their homes would involve a drastic demographic shift. A senior U.S. State Department official described the plan as “probably the craziest idea I’ve ever heard”. Reports in July of some refugees being forcibly deported from Istanbul have raised concerns about any large-scale returns. Turkey says it has not sent any Syrians back against their will. Czech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek, voicing widely held European concerns, said Syrian refugees should be able to return voluntarily. “I don’t think, however, that they should be returned by any military operation, Turkish or otherwise,” he said. A European diplomat said the European Union, which has disbursed most of a 6 billion euro aid package to help Turkey host refugees on its soil, would also look skeptically at any request for funding projects inside Syria before any political settlement is reached to end its eight-year conflict. Ankara has dismissed the concerns about the impact of a return of refugees from Turkey, saying any change to the population would only be redressing moves by the Kurdish forces which currently control the region.  “Turkey ... has no interest in occupation or changing demographics. The PKK/YPG did that in northeast Syria. Time to correct it,” Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin tweeted. For Ankara, which views Kurdish YPG fighters in northeast Syria as terrorists because of their ties to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey, an influx of non-Kurdish Syrians would help it secure a buffer against its main security threat.      Other areas of Syria have seen drastic population changes, with rebellious Sunni neighborhoods of Homs and Damascus emptied by the fighting. Villages in northern and western Syria have seen deals to evacuate Sunni and Shi’ite residents. CEMENT SHARES RISE Before heading to the United Nations last month, Erdogan said that the Turkish-controlled zone “will both allow the refugees we have to return to their lands, and allow for all their needs, from education, health, shelter to be met. “It will allow them to live on their own lands (instead of) the tent towns and container cities,” he told Reuters. He later said the number of Syrians returning could rise to 3 million if Turkey’s incursion went beyond the 20 mile (32 km) “safe zone” it plans to establish inside northeast Syria.  Turkey has already launched two military incursions in Syria’s northwest and says those operations showed it can restore services and infrastructure to areas devastated by war. “In the safe zones we create, we have made sure the conditions to live like humans are met and will continue to do so,” Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Tuesday. He said Turkey had brought security, health, education, shelter, roads, water and electricity, allowing 370,000 Syrian refugees to return. Erdogan made no mention of the cost of his plans for northeast Syria, but state broadcaster TRT gave a figure of 151 billion lira ($27 billion). That figure, and the scale of the potential construction projects, has already lifted shares in Turkish cement companies that have production plants close to the Syrian border.  Mardin Cimento (MRDIN.IS) and Adana Cimento (ADNAC.IS) stocks have risen for two straight days this week on expectations business opportunities in the area. “The buying is due to developments in Syria ... the expectation of reconstruction in the region,” said an analyst at one Turkish brokerage.  In theory, a building boom on its southern border is exactly the boost Turkey’s economy needs. It slipped into recession at the end of last year, following years of growth fueled by a surge in construction funded by cheap credit. Firms in the sector have been amongst the hardest hit from the downturn. Where the money would come from to fund the building projects - even assuming Turkey is able to control the 300 mile (500 km) wide strip border - is another question.  “When you look at the length of the border and the Turks say they want a safe zone all along it ... demilitarised, controlled by Turkey and then to put 3 million refugees there and get the Europeans to pay $26 billion, it’s not going to happen,” a European diplomatic source said. “It’s not realistic and it’s pure fantasy.” ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
70,Weak U.S. producer inflation bolsters case for Fed rate cut,"U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in September, leading to the smallest annual increase in nearly three years, likely giving the Federal Reserve further room to cut interest rates for the third time this year in October. The weak producer inflation readings reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday came against the backdrop of a slowing  economy amid trade tensions and cooling growth overseas. The Trump administration’s 15-month trade war with China has eroded business investment and pushed manufacturing into recession. Economists say the broad weakness in producer inflation was a reflection of the downturn in the factory sector.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday signaled openness to more rate cuts amid rising global economic risks, reiterating that the U.S. central bank would “act as appropriate to support continued growth, a strong job market and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2% objective.”  The producer price index for final demand dropped 0.3% last month, weighed down by decreases in the costs of goods and services, the government said. That was the largest decline since January and followed a 0.1% gain in August. In the 12 months through September the PPI increased 1.4%, the smallest gain since November 2016, after rising 1.8% in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI nudging up 0.1% in September and advancing 1.8% on a year-on-year basis. Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices were unchanged last month after jumping 0.4% in August. The so-called core PPI increased 1.7% in the 12 months through September after climbing 1.9% in August. “This is helping to build the case for the Fed to take out some more insurance to guard against a broader downturn in the economy ,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “The trade war is hurting margins and pricing power for manufacturers, making it hard to see how America is winning this trade war with the world.” The Fed, which has a 2% annual inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy. The core PCE price index rose 1.8% on a year-on-year basis in August and has undershot its target this year. Some economists expect the central bank could cut rates at its Oct. 29-30 policy meeting amid signs that the U.S.-China trade war was impacting the broader economy.  While the unemployment rate dropped to near a 50-year low of 3.5% in September, hiring slowed significantly, with the three-month average gain in private payrolls falling to 119,000 jobs, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August. In addition, private services industry growth slowed to a three-year low in September. A report on Tuesday from the National Federation of Independent Business showed confidence among small businesses dropped in September. The NFIB said the trade war was “adversely impacting many small firms,” noting that “owners are more reluctant to make major spending commitments.” The Fed cut rates in September after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008, to keep the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, on track. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the inflation data as investors digested news that the White House was moving ahead with discussions around possible restrictions on capital flows into China, with a focus on investments made by U.S. government pension funds. The dollar gained against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, but trimmed losses after Powell’s comments. BROAD WEAKNESS Though the relationship between producer and consumer inflation has weakened following the revamping of the PPI basket several years ago, economists expect a weak consumer price index reading in September. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the CPI likely rose 0.1% in September after a similar gain in August.      “The drop in the PPI in September does lend some downside risk to the CPI forecast,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The CPI data will be published on Thursday. In September, wholesale energy prices fell 2.5%, matching August’s decline. They were pulled down by a 7.2% decline in gasoline prices, which followed a 6.6% percent drop in August. Gasoline accounted for three quarters of the 0.4% drop in goods prices last month. Goods prices decreased 0.5% in August.  In the 12 months through September, goods prices declined 0.5%, the most since August 2016.     Wholesale food prices rebounded 0.3% in September, lifted by a 26.8% surge in the cost of chicken eggs. Food prices dropped 0.6% in August. Core goods prices fell 0.1% last month. They were unchanged in August.  The cost of services fell 0.2%, the most since February 2017, after increasing 0.3% in August. Services were dragged down by a 1.0% tumble in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Nearly half of the drop in services was attributed to a 2.7% decrease in machinery and vehicle wholesaling.  The cost of healthcare services rose 0.3% after climbing 0.2% in August. The cost of hospital outpatient care surged 1.1%, the biggest rise since 2014, after slipping 0.1% in August.  There were gains in the costs of doctor visits and hospital inpatient care. Portfolio management fees were unchanged last month after increasing 0.5% in August. Those fees and healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index. FILE PHOTO: A production line employee works at the AMES Companies shovel manufacturing factory in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, U.S. on June 29, 2017.    REUTERS/Tim Aeppel/File PhotoEconomists at JPMorgan said while they expected medical care costs in the core PCE price index to jump 0.4% in September after being soft in August, they did not anticipate a similarly strong core inflation reading. “The broader core PCE price index may not be especially strong given softness in some other PPI components that are used as source data for PCE prices,” said JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver.  The September PCE price index data will be published at the end of the month. ",Top-Nachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
71,Science of far-away planets and infant universe wins Nobel prize,"Canadian-American cosmologist James Peebles and Swiss scientists Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz won the 2019 Nobel Prize for Physics on Tuesday for revealing the wonder of the evolution of the universe and discovering planets orbiting distant suns.     Peebles, of Princeton University in the United States, was awarded half of the 9-million-Swedish-crown ($910,000) prize while Mayor and Queloz, from Switzerland’s University of Geneva and Britain’s Cambridge University, shared the rest. “This year’s Nobel laureates have painted a picture of our universe far stranger and more wonderful than we could ever have imagined,” Ulf Danielsson, a professor and member of the Nobel Committee for Physics, told reporters as the prize was announced. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the scientists’ research had “transformed our ideas about the cosmos”. Mayor and his one-time doctoral student Queloz said it was “simply extraordinary” to be awarded a Nobel for what they described as “the most exciting discovery of our entire career”. The pair announced the first discovery of a planet outside our own solar system, a so-called “exoplanet”, in 1995. “The study of exoplanets is perhaps the most vibrant field of astronomy,” Martin Rees, a Cambridge University professor and Astronomer Royal, said in a emailed comment. “We now know that most stars are orbited by retinues of planets; there may be a billion planets in our galaxy resembling the Earth,” Rees added. Since their discovery, more than 4,000 exoplanets have been found in the Milky Way, many of them nothing like our own world. Indeed, the first planet they found, 51 Pegasi b, orbits a sun 50 light years away that heats its surface to more than 1,000 degrees centigrade, the award-giving academy said. Goran K Hansson (C), Secretary General of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and academy members Mats Larsson (L) and Ulf Danielsson, announce winners of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics during a news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, Sweden, October 8, 2019. The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to James Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. Claudio Bresciani/TT News Agency/via REUTERS With numerous ongoing searches for more exoplanets, this science might eventually also “find an answer to the eternal question of whether other life is out there,” it said. At a news conference in London, Queloz said the focus of research had now shifted from finding more planets to finding out more about them - about their atmosphere, chemistry and formation. Queloz also fielded inevitable questions about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. “I can’t believe that we’re the only living entities in the universe,” he said when asked if he believes “aliens” exist. “The chemistry that led to life is everywhere, so I’m a strong believer that there must be life elsewhere.”  DARK MATTER Peebles thanked the Nobel committee for the award, although he said his advice to young people wishing to go into science would be not to be lured by the prospect of such prizes. “The awards and prizes, well, they are charming and very much appreciated, but...you should enter science because you are fascinated by it. That’s what I did,” he told reporters by telephone after the award announcement. Physics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week; William Kaelin, Gregg Semenza and Peter Ratcliffe shared the medicine prize on Monday for discoveries about how cells respond to oxygen levels.  The Nobel prizes were created in a bequest by Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901. This year’s physics prize will be followed by the awards for chemistry on Wednesday, literature on Thursday and the peace prize on Friday. Among the Nobels, physics has often taken centre stage with winners featuring some of the greatest names in the history of science such as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Niels Bohr, as well as inventors such as radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi. Using theoretical tools and calculations, Peebles was able to interpret trace radiation from the infancy of the universe and discover new physical processes, the Nobel academy said.

72,BlackRock bets on the circular economy with new fund,"BlackRock (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, is actively investing in companies including Adidas (ADSGn.DE), Tomra (TOM.OL) and Ball Corp (BLL.N) through a new circular economy fund that bets on sustainable business. FILE PHOTO: The BlackRock logo is seen outside of its offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016.  REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoBlackRock, which has $6.84 trillion in assets under management, is the biggest investor in fossil fuels and has faced criticism particularly for its continued exposure to coal. It says much of that is through passive, index-linked investment, which accounts for roughly 90% of its equity assets, and that it is also the biggest investor in renewable energy. Sumana Manohar, a manager of the new fund which has been launched with charity the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, told reporters in London on Tuesday it was focused on exposure to scrap, recycling and reducing plastic waste, and is actively managed. Started on Oct. 2 with $20 million of seed capital, the fund is spread over 30 to 50 companies.     As examples, Manohar cited Adidas, which has committed to using recycled plastic and recycled polyester, Norway’s Tomra, which provides what it calls “reverse vending machines” that allow consumers to return glass bottles and cans to supermarkets, and U.S. company Ball Corp, which makes recyclable aluminum packaging. Graphic: MSCI vs Adidas vs Tomra vs Ball - here.jpg Manohar declined to name any other companies, but said she expected the fund to expand over the coming years and include, for instance, recycling businesses that provide battery minerals.     Evy Hambro, global head of thematic and sector investing at BlackRock and who is also running the new fund, said the company had been assessing for about three years sustainability as a risk and an opportunity.  Speaking at a mining conference in Johannesburg last week, Hambro, who co-manages the BlackRock World Mining Trust (BRWM.L), said flows into investment funds labeled environmentally-friendly will increase the cost of capital rises for companies seen as less sustainable. One result of the analysis of risk and business disruption, Hambro said, had been the partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Named after the British yachtswoman who set a record for circumnavigating the globe, it focuses on shifting the economy to a circular model that eliminates waste. Andrew Morlet, the foundation’s chief executive, said it had previously worked closely with companies, governments and cities and the education system. “The finance sector is a very important part of accelerating this transition,” he said.

73,French PM questions U.S. hesitations over northeast Syria,"France’s prime minister defended his country’s policy in northeastern Syria on Tuesday saying that, unlike U.S. hesitations, Paris’ priority remained to defeat Islamic State and preserve Kurdish-ked forces fighting the militant group. The U.S. decision to withdraw from northeastern Syria leaving Turkey to launch an offensive against Kurdish militants in the region has rattled allies, including France, one of Washington’s main partners in the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State. Responding in parliament to criticism of the French government from some opposition lawmakers for not publicly defending Kurdish forces in the face of a possible Turkish offensive, Edouard Philippe said Paris had not wavered on its policy unlike Washington.   “The fight against Daesh (Islamic State) is not over and continues alongside the (Kurdish-led) Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF),” Phillipe told lawmakers. “Saying things with constancy and coherence is preferable to reacting to obvious hesitations from certain players notably our American friends,” Philippe said, alluding to differences in the U.S. administration.    President Donald Trump denied on Tuesday that he had abandoned the Kurdish forces. However, he praised Turkey as a trade partner, in a softening of tone hours after threatening Ankara’s economy if it acted “off limits” in Syria. ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
74,"After bloodshed hits flashpoint district, Iraq scrambles to stem violence","Days of deadly anti-government protests in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities brought few real concessions from the authorities. But when bloodshed spread to one particular poor, restive Baghdad district, they responded differently. After protesters were killed in Sadr City, the military ordered an army withdrawal from the area and security forces for the first time admitted using excessive force, promising to hold those involved in violence against civilians to account. More money has also been promised to help the poor. Signs of an escalation in the sprawling residential district, from where Shi’ite insurgents once attacked U.S. forces after the 2003 U.S. invasion, spooked the government as it would mean serious trouble for Iraq and much bloodier unrest, security forces, local leaders, lawmakers and analysts say. “There will be angry people who have lost a brother or a relative - they’ll want to seek revenge through tribes,” said Sheikh Shiyaa al-Bahadli, a local tribal leader. “We’ve been trying to calm things, talking to protesters who are all our kin, because if things move towards use of weapons or parties get involved, Iraq will spiral out of control and there will be more bloodshed.” He warned, however, that the government must take steps to enact real reform, blaming corrupt authorities for the unrest, or the protests would continue. Some analysts agree that government reforms are unlikely to be enough to satisfy many Iraqis, who call for an overhaul of the entire political system and a despised ruling class they say has kept life miserable for most Iraqis even in peacetime. FEARS OF SPIRAL The protests, which erupted in central Baghdad last week and spread to southern cities, reached Sadr City for the first time on Sunday. More than a dozen deaths there brought the total number killed to at least 110, mostly protesters. The unrest shattered nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which lived through foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State (IS) insurgency between 2003 and 2017. It is the biggest challenge to security since IS was declared beaten. Many protesters are young men from the sprawling suburb, a symbol of the poor services, lack of jobs and endemic government corruption that sparked public anger - and home to many armed supporters of powerful cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr, a cleric with revered Shi’ite heritage who can mobilize tens of thousands of supporters, sided with the demonstrators last week and demanded the government resign and call elections, showing his opposition to a government and parliament dominated by Iran-backed political and paramilitary forces. But he stopped short of urging his supporters to street action. State television reported on Tuesday that Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi was meeting influential religious and tribal leaders to seek a way out of the crisis. Underscoring the risks of a spiral of violence, in Baghdad one member of the security forces was killed overnight and four wounded by gunfire from a crowd of protesters including families of those slain in Sadr City on Sunday, police said. The government initially proposed handouts for the poor and greater job opportunities for graduates. In Baghdad on Tuesday, dozens of people queued outside the labor ministry in hopes of receiving new promised stipends. A lawmaker from a grouping of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a umbrella group of Iran-backed paramilitaries, said moves could now include sacking security chiefs in Baghdad and provinces where violence broke out. “The government is compensating the families of those killed - both protesters and security personnel,” Abdul Amir al-Taiban said. WARNINGS OF BIGGER CRACKDOWN The initial response to the protests was fierce. Reuters journalists have witnessed protesters being killed and wounded by snipers among the security forces firing into crowds from rooftops though the interior ministry denies government forces have shot directly at protesters. Violence in Sadr City, whose narrow streets are home to a third of Baghdad’s 8 million people, had likely pushed politicians to at least appear to act more meaningfully to address protesters’ concerns, said Professor Toby Dodge of the London School of Economics. “Sadr City always looms large as the uncontrollable specter on the fringes of the city ... killing large numbers of people in Sadr City is going to trigger a cycle of death and revenge,” he said. “That Sadr City comes into play – and that high level of violence used has triggered this apology,” he said, referring to official statements admitting security forces had erred. Hawkish pro-Iran figures have meanwhile laid the blame for violence on alleged infiltrators backed by foreign enemies, warning that while reform is enacted, further demonstrations could be met with more force. “Some say protests were a surprise and spontaneous, but we had other intelligence indications,” PMF chief Falih al-Fayyadh said on Monday, without elaborating. “Our response to those who want ill for the country will be clear and precise by the state and its instruments ... there will be no chance for a coup or rebellion” he said, adding that foreign powers sought to benefit from chaos in Iraq - a nod to Iran’s enemies Saudi Arabia and the United States. Slideshow (3 Images)Dodge said that for all promises of reform, authorities would rely on force to maintain the status quo. “There’s a formula - where you start with a crackdown, then you promise heaven and earth in the hope that everyone will forget the promises and start again when the weather cools down,” he said. “The way the ruling elite dealt with this upsurge in popular protest is incredibly coercive. Turning off the internet, targeting journalists – I think that is a marked step towards authoritarianism.”​ ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters

76,House Democrats subpoena White House for documents in Trump impeachment probe,"U.S. House Democrats on Friday subpoenaed the White House for documents they want to see as part of their impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump. The chairmen of three House of Representatives committees said they want documents related to a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that is at the heart of their inquiry. The three said they were forced to issue the subpoena after the White House failed to produce documents they requested in a Sept. 9 letter. “We deeply regret that President Trump has put us - and the nation - in this position, but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena,” said Representatives Elijah Cummings of the Oversight Committee, Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee and Eliot Engel of the Foreign Affairs Committee. They gave the White House until Oct. 18 to produce the information, including who else besides Trump was on the phone call with Zelenskiy. “This subpoena changes nothing - just more document requests, wasted time, and taxpayer dollars that will ultimately show the President did nothing wrong,” White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. White House lawyers believe Trump, a Republican, can ignore lawmakers’ demands until the Democratic-controlled House holds a full vote of the chamber to formally approve of the impeachment inquiry, according to a person familiar with the matter. Earlier, the committees asked Vice President Mike Pence to hand over documents relating to a meeting he held with Zelenskiy and the call between Zelenskiy and Trump. They gave Pence until Oct. 15 to produce any records relating to the July call and a meeting he held with Zelenskiy on Sept. 1. According to a partial transcript of the call, Trump asked Zelenskiy the “favor” of investigating former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, and his son, Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma.

Trump is running for re-election.     “Recently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president’s stark message to the Ukrainian president,” Cummings,  Schiff and Engel wrote in a letter to Pence. A spokeswoman for Pence said the broad nature of the request showed that it was not “serious.” When Pence met with Zelenskiy, the two discussed the $250 million in security assistance that the U.S. Congress had approved but that the Trump administration had not disbursed. WHISTLEBLOWER The contents of the Trump-Zelenskiy call were revealed by a member of the intelligence community who filed a whistleblower complaint and remains anonymous. Trump has said he wants to know the whistleblower’s identity. Democratic Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of the Intelligence Committee, said he believed the whistleblower’s identity should be kept secret even from members of the panel. “I think that the less we know about that person, the more protected he or she will be,” Krishnamoorthi told Reuters. A second intelligence official, who has more direct information about Trump’s dealings with Ukraine than the first whistleblower, is also considering filing a whistleblower complaint, the New York Times reported, citing two people briefed on the matter. The second official is among those interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the allegations of the original whistleblower, one of the people said, according to the Times. The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, testified before a closed-door session of the House Intelligence Committee on Friday.   U.S. President Donald Trump gives a thumbs up after delivering remarks at Young Black Leadership Summit at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 4, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri GripasThe investigation could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate. Republicans who control the Senate have shown little appetite for ousting Trump. A cache of diplomatic texts Democrats received as part of their impeachment inquiry showed U.S. officials pressured the Ukrainian government to launch investigations that might benefit Trump’s personal political agenda in exchange for a meeting of the two countries’ leaders. Kurt Volker, who resigned last week as Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, gave the messages to the House committees in a closed-door meeting on Thursday, and the chairmen released them later in the day. ROMNEY PUSHES BACK  Trump has said Biden and his son are “corrupt” but has shown no evidence to back that up. The president on Thursday went a step further in his attacks on Biden when he called on China to investigate the former vice president and his son, who had business interests there.         U.S. senator and former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said on Friday it was “wrong and appalling” for Trump to push other nations to investigate Biden. “When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China’s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,” Romney said on Twitter.          Trump said on Friday he would not tie a much-anticipated trade deal with China to his desire for Beijing to investigate Joe Biden. “One thing has nothing to do with the other,” he said.    Biden leads in most opinion polls among the 19 Democrats seeking the party’s nomination. His campaign has blasted Trump’s efforts as desperate.  In a signal of how Kiev will handle investigations being watched in Washington, Ukrainian prosecutors said they would review 15 old probes related to Burisma’s founder but added that they were unaware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Biden’s son.   The White House plans to argue that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, must have the full House vote to formally approve an impeachment inquiry, a source familiar with the effort said. Slideshow (5 Images)Without a vote, White House lawyers believe Trump, who has called the impeachment probe a “hoax,” can ignore lawmakers’ requests, the source said, meaning the federal courts would presumably have to render a decision and potentially slow the march toward impeachment.

The U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee issued a subpoena on Sept. 27 for Pompeo, a close Trump ally, seeking to compel him to hand over documents concerning contact with the Ukrainian government. House Democrats are examining whether there are grounds to impeach Trump based on a whistleblower’s complaint that said he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to help investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son.    “The State Department sent a letter last night to Congress, which is our initial response to the document request. We will obviously do all the things we are required to by law,” Pompeo said in a news conference in Greece. He did not elaborate on the contents of the letter.  Pompeo objected last week to efforts by Democrats to obtain depositions from current and former department officials as part of the investigation into whether Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart for a probe of Biden and his son in a July 25 call. Lawmakers are looking at whether Trump jeopardized national security and the integrity of U.S. elections for personal political gain. Trump has called the impeachment investigation a “hoax” and accused the media and Democrats of corruption.  ‘CHANGES NOTHING’ An official from the House Foreign Affairs Committee said in a statement to Reuters on Saturday that Pompeo had “failed to meet the deadline to produce documents required by the subpoena,” but confirmed the State Department had contacted the three investigating committees. “We hope the Department will cooperate in full promptly,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  Pompeo, who has acknowledged he listened to the July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskiy, said the Trump administration was “incredibly focused in making sure that we worked with Ukraine in a way that was appropriate.” House Democrats on Friday subpoenaed the White House for documents they want to see as part of their impeachment investigation. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said on Friday that the subpoena “changes nothing” and that it would be ultimately shown that Trump did nothing wrong. Pompeo, on the last leg of a trip to southern Europe, said there were “clearly politics” involved in the investigation. He also addressed a notion Trump has long held that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a theory that runs counter to the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that it was Russia that meddled in the campaign.

REUTERS/Costas Baltas/PoolPompeo said “governments have an obligation and indeed a duty to make sure that elections happen with integrity, without interference from any government, whether that’s the Ukrainian government or any other.” Pompeo, a former U.S. congressman, said there had been congressional inquiries in the past that had harassed and abused State Department employees by contacting them directly and seeking to have them provide documents and records.  “That’s harassment and I will never let that happen to my people,” he said.

78,Pompeo calls Ukraine inquiry 'silly gotcha game',"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the Ukraine inquiry a ‘silly gotcha game’ on Saturday. “This is what’s wrong when the world doesn’t focus on the things that are right, the things that matter, the things that impact real people’s lives and instead you get caught up in some silly gotcha game.”  “You see, that’s not helpful, that doesn’t help democracies flourish,” said Pompeo, who is visiting Greece on the final leg of a tour of countries in southern Europe.  His response came when he was asked at the end of a speech whether there were any ‘red flags’ which required further investigation in a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July.  “I don’t think anybody here is particularly interested in that...I think they want to know about the relationship between America and Greece.”  The July call is now the subject of a congressional investigation.

79,EU's Vestager says breaking up companies is last option,"Europe’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday she preferred to use fines or other penalties on rule-busting companies rather than break them up, saying this approach would be less disruptive to the companies and the market. European Commissioner-designate for Europe Fit for Digital Age Margrethe Vestager of Denmark attends her hearing before the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium October 8, 2019. REUTERS/Francois LenoirVestager is staying on in her job as European Competition Commissioner for another five years and now enjoys additional regulatory power to target the technology industry as part of a broader role ensuring Europe is fit for the digital age.   Calls from critics and politicians to break up tech giants accused of abusing their position to squash competitors have intensified in recent months, especially in the United States. Vestager, a former Danish economics minister, has gained a reputation as a tough enforcer, notably with a record fine totaling more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) on Alphabet unit Google (GOOGL.O) for throttling rivals. Asked if she would consider breaking up companies that violate rules, Vestager told her confirmation hearing at the European Parliament that it was not her favored option. “Breaking up companies, well, this is a tool that we have available, it can be done. The thing is I have obligation to use the least intrusive tool in order to restore fair competition,” she told lawmakers in a packed chamber. “Since it is quite a thing to break up a company, obviously I have an obligation to try what else can be a good tool to solve the situation that we are in,” she said. Vestager has in the past years handed out hefty fines as well as ordered companies to change their business practices. She is expected to order U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) to suspend some business practices until she completes her investigation into potential anti-competitive business practices, according to a source. At the hearing, she said such interim measures had benefits.  “We find it a high priority to speed up what we do,” she said. An interim measure against Broadcom expected in the coming weeks would be the European Commission’s first in almost two decades. It bans certain activities until the regulator completes its years-long investigations and could pave the way for similar action against other tech companies. Vestager also dismissed concerns of conflicts between her enforcer and new regulatory role, saying Commission decisions were taken jointly by commissioners and reinforced by independent advice from the EU executive’s lawyers and economists. The Commission as a whole requires EU lawmakers’ approval before taking office in November. ",Top-Nachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
80,Nissan pins revival hopes on 'foreigner with a Japanese face',"Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) named the head of its Chinese business as its next CEO on Tuesday, picking an executive known for close ties to top shareholder Renault (RENA.PA) and for a frank, straight-talking manner that has marked him as an outsider. By selecting Senior Vice President Makoto Uchida, Nissan’s board has gone with someone slightly at odds with its traditional corporate culture. He joined the carmaker mid-career in 2003, a rarity in a country where top executives usually spend their entire working lives at the same company. Known for his unflagging work ethic and relentless focus on cost control, Uchida was described by one long-time associate who spoke on condition of anonymity as a “foreigner with a Japanese face” - direct and to the point in conversations. He will be joined by newly appointed Chief Operating Officer (COO) Ashwani Gupta, currently COO of junior partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T), in trying to find new ways to revive a business that has been struggling for months with plunging profits, management scandal and tensions with Renault. Japan’s second-largest automaker has been shaken in particular by the arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn last year on allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies, and the more recent departure of CEO Hiroto Saikawa after he admitted to being improperly overpaid. Whether the 53-year-old former theology student can deliver a miracle turnaround - particularly at Nissan’s business in the United States - and repair ties with Renault will now be a focus for investors.    “The biggest business challenge for Nissan is speeding up,” the head of Nissan’s nominations committee, Masakazu Toyoda, told a news conference.  “Speedy decision making is a challenge that Uchida raised, and to this end he said that he wants to empower people as much as possible, so we decided to ask Uchida to take on the CEO role.” One source close to Renault described the selection as “a victory for the alliance”, saying that both Uchida and Gupta knew the business and were ready to help Nissan recover. FILE PHOTO: The Nissan logo is seen at Nissan car plant in Sunderland, Britain February 4, 2019. REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo‘ISN’T REALLY JAPANESE’ Before his ouster, Ghosn had been working on a plan for a full merger of Renault and Nissan, but had met resistance in Japan, which is concerned about French influence in the alliance. The French government is a major Renault shareholder. Relations were further strained this year when Renault held abortive merger talks with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU.N).   Nissan’s former China chief Jun Seki, who was seen as one of the top contenders for the CEO job, will be vice COO, the company said. The three appointees will take up their positions by Jan. 1.  “All three are global citizens, attach importance to the alliance, and are motivated to speed decision making” Toyoda said. The Uchida associate described him as a “Japanese person who isn’t really Japanese inside. Very direct in his language, to the point, easy to understand.” He is extremely proficient in English and worked with Renault, which owns 43.4% of Nissan, on alliance procurement.  Although he is steeped in cost control and rose through ranks in purchasing and procurement - two key things for Nissan - there are other traits that mark him as an outsider. Unlike other top executives, he has not spent his entire career at Nissan, having joined from Nissho Iwai, now part of trading house Sojitz. He also graduated from Doshisha University in Kyoto, where he studied theology. Many top executives in Japan come from the University of Tokyo, and often study law. As such he is seen as a “tozama”, a lord who was considered an outsider in feudal Japan, the associate said. Slideshow (2 Images)Directors at Nissan, including those from Renault, voted unanimously in favor of the two executives, a source familiar with the matter said. APE, which handles the French state’s holdings in companies, said it was delighted “with a unanimous decision that will allow Nissan and the alliance to move forward.” ",Top-Nachrichten,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters

82,Trump defends U.S. relations with Turkey after bipartisan backlash,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday continued to defend Washington’s relationship with Turkey after a bipartisan backlash over his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria. Critics fear the move will open the way for a Turkish strike on Kurdish-led forces long allied with Washington who have led the fight against the Islamic State militant group in Syria. Turkey says those forces are terrorists because of their ties to Kurdish militants who have waged a long insurgency in Turkey. “So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States,” Trump wrote in posts on Twitter, adding, “They have also been good to deal with ... Also remember, and importantly, that Turkey is an important member in good standing of NATO.” He also insisted Washington was not abandoning the Kurdish-led forces, writing on Twitter: “We may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters.” The Kurdish-led forces have said they may launch talks with Damascus or Moscow to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full U.S. withdrawal from the area. The Turkish Defense Ministry said late on Monday that it had completed preparations for a possible military operation in northeastern Syria. ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters

84,Thai zoo solves mystery of celebrity panda's death,"When a celebrity giant panda died suddenly last month while on loan to Thailand’s Chiang Mai Zoo, millions of social media users in China demanded to know “What killed Chuang Chuang?”  FILE PHOTO: Chuang Chuang, a giant panda on loan to Thailand from China, eats bamboo at the Chiang Mai Zoo in Chiang Mai province, north of Bangkok, September 3, 2005. REUTERS/Chaiwat Subprasom/File PhotoOn Tuesday, they learned it was heart failure, according to a Chinese-assisted autopsy on the death of 19-year-old Chuang Chuang, who had been on loan from China since 2003 with his mate Lin Hui. They were celebrities in Thailand, with media extensively covering their love life - including a “wedding” ceremony  in 2005. Chuang Chuang's relatively early demise sparked mourning among Thai fans and an outcry here on Chinese social media, where a hashtag seeming to blame Thailand for the death was viewed 250 million times. Pandas generally live 14-20 years in the wild but can live up to 30 years in captivity. The Chiang Mai Zoo said any speculation in China that Chuang Chuang - who was known for being obese - may have died due to careless feeding, neglect or even some kind of attack had proved unfounded. “The autopsy and analysis by Chinese-Thai experts showed that the nutrition health of Giant Panda Chuang Chuang was good, no external wounds were found and no foreign objects were found in his trachea,” the zoo said in a statement on Tuesday. “The cause of his death was heart failure, resulting in the lack of oxygen of internal organs and leading to his death.” The zoo confirmed that Thailand would nonetheless pay unspecified compensation to Beijing as outlined in the original loan agreement.  Chuang Chuang’s mate, Lin Hui, would stay at the zoo for the time being, it said. Chuang Chuang famously was put on a diet in 2007 when the zoo was trying to encourage he and Lin Hui to conceive. The zoo even resorted to ""panda porn"" videos here of other pandas mating to encourage Chuang Chuang, but Lin Hui eventually conceived through artificial insemination.  After Lin Hui gave birth in 2009, their offspring was featured on a 24-hour “Panda Channel” shown on a Thai TV network. Baby pandas are rarely born in captivity, and the offspring was eventually returned to China. Soon after Chuang Chuang’s death, footage of Lin Hui alone in her enclosure next to her mate’s empty pen was aired around the world and a Chinese official said there was talk she may be returned to China amid concerns she would be lonely. No decision on her future has been made, but the zoo said “in the meantime, Thailand will continue (to) take best care of the remaining panda Lin Hui.” ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
85,U.S. House panel chief: State Department withholding key witness' messages,"The U.S. State Department is withholding messages from the ambassador to the European Union that are relevant to the impeachment inquiry, the chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee said on Tuesday. “Not only is the Congress being deprived of his testimony ... but we are also aware that the ambassador has text messages or emails on a personal device, which had been provided to the State Department, although we have requested those from the ambassador, and the State Department is withholding those messages as well,” Adam Schiff told reporters.  “Those messages are also deeply relevant to this investigation and the impeachment inquiry,” Schiff added. Representatives for the State Department could not be immediately reached for a response. The Trump administration on Tuesday blocked the ambassador, Gordon Sondland, who had agreed to appear voluntarily, from testifying behind closed doors before three House panels, including Schiff’s. “The failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents — we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress - a co-equal branch of government,” Schiff said. “By preventing us from hearing from this witness and obtaining these documents, the president and secretary of state are taking actions that prevent us from getting the facts needed to protect the nation’s security.” ",Politik,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
86,Index funds invest trillions but rarely challenge management,"Index funds now control half the U.S. stock mutual fund market, giving the biggest funds enormous power to influence decisions and demand better returns at the companies in which they invest trillions of dollars. FILE PHOTO: Blackrock's Richard Prager rings the opening bell above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S. May 31, 2019. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File PhotoBut the leading U.S. index fund firms, BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp, rarely use that clout. Instead, they overwhelmingly support the decisions and pay packages of executives at the companies in their portfolios, including the worst performers, according to a Reuters analysis of their shareholder-voting records. The three fund firms, for instance, supported doubling the pay of the chief executive at California utility PG&E Corp after its stock plummeted over potential liability from maintenance problems linked to California wildfires. The funds supported big pay packages for executives at beauty products company Coty Inc - including nearly $500,000 for their children’s tuition - as the company struggled to digest its acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty business. And all three cast pivotal votes against the proposed reform of splitting the CEO and chairman roles at General Electric Co after a decade of poor performance.  Such votes reflect a larger trend of deference to management, according to an analysis of proxy voting at 300 of the worst-performing companies in the Russell 3000 index, as measured by three-year returns through the end of 2018. The analysis was conducted for Reuters by shareholder-voting data firm Proxy Insight. The study looked at the 300 worst performers who held proxy votes in 2018. It found that BlackRock voted with management 93% of the time, followed by Vanguard at 91% and State Street at 84% during the proxy year ended June 30, 2018. The analysis showed that the three index fund firms supported management at the worst-performing Russell 3000 firms only slightly less often than they did for all companies in the index, regardless of performance. “If we think that informed and engaged shareholders play an important role in disciplining company management, the rise of index investing is a problem,” said Dorothy Lund, a law professor at USC’s Gould School of Law and an author of several published corporate-governance studies. Actively managed funds also routinely support management in proxy ballots. But their voting records are not directly comparable to those of index funds because active managers routinely signal their displeasure with company management by simply dumping a stock or never buying it. Index funds, by contrast, are prevented from active trading by their own rules because they aim to match, rather than beat, the market. They are required to own all the companies in the index they track, such as the Russell 3000 or the S&P 500 - high-flyers and dogs alike. That leaves proxy voting as the primary leverage for index funds firms to hold companies accountable for practices that undermine shareholders’ interests, such as exorbitant executive pay. But the index providers face powerful disincentives in confronting management at the companies in their portfolios, industry experts said. With no mission to outperform market indices, the funds lack a financial incentive to ensure that portfolio companies are well-run, Lund said. Their business models also rely heavily on recruiting everyday investors away from actively managed mutual funds with the promise of lower fees. And large companies - like the ones in major stock indexes - are key to acquiring new customers for the big fund firms: BlackRock, Vanguard and rival firms count on corporations to offer their funds to employees in retirement plans, which often limit the options workers can select. Those vital business relationships mean index funds treat their portfolio companies more like clients, Lund said in an interview. “The problem is going to be greater as these index funds get more money,” she said. The index fund firms say they take seriously the watchdog role that institutional investors have historically played in the stock market. Proxy voting, they say, is only a small part of their regular engagement with companies, and they prefer to address problems privately. “Continuing to have a dialogue without airing all of our dirty laundry” helps maintain long-term relationships, said Glenn Booraem, who oversees Vanguard’s proxy voting and its interaction with portfolio companies. BlackRock said it talks or emails with executives and directors - sometimes for years - before voting against them. “A vote against management is a sign of a failed engagement,” Michelle Edkins, who oversees BlackRock’s proxy voting, said in an interview. “It’s wrong to measure the effectiveness of BlackRock’s investment stewardship efforts solely by our proxy voting record,” BlackRock said in a statement. “That fails to recognize our process of engaging directly with companies to enhance the long-term value of our clients’ assets.” BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard all declined requests to discuss their votes on specific proxy proposals at poor-performing firms, or to provide details of their private interventions at laggard companies. State Street declined to make executives available for comment. “We use our voice and vote to influence companies on long-term governance and sustainability issues,” State Street spokeswoman Olivia Offner said in an email. Proxy votes on proposals by the company or its shareholders, influence key issues of executive pay, director appointments and strategic plans, along with a company’s actions to address controversial issues such as climate change or gender pay equity. BlackRock opposed executive pay just 3% of the time in 2018 at Russell 3000 companies and Vanguard opposed pay 5% of the time, according to Proxy Insight. State Street funds did not support pay 9% of the time in that group of companies, according to Proxy Insight. The figure includes a small number of abstentions by State Street. Compare that to America’s largest public retirement funds. The $378 billion California Public Employees’ Retirement System opposed executive pay 53% of the time in the first seven months of 2019 at U.S. companies, according to its latest report. The $210 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund opposed executive pay packages 27% of the time last year at U.S. companies, a spokesman for the fund said. The $200 billion retirement system run by the Florida State Board of Administration voted against executive compensation 64% of the time among 2,226 U.S. companies during the twelve months ended June 30, Jacob Williams, the system’s corporate governance manager, told Reuters.  Some activist investors cite the low rate of negative votes by top investors as a reason for the persistence of unpopular corporate practices, such as rich executive compensation and poor disclosure of climate impacts. Median CEO pay rose 25% to $12.1 million in 2018 from $9.7 million in 2014 at the 500 largest publicly-traded U.S. companies by revenue, according to the latest disclosures analyzed by executive pay researcher Equilar. Company leaders usually won’t even discuss an issue unless about a third of investors cast opposing votes, said Tim Brennan, who until June oversaw proxy votes and resolutions as chief financial officer for the Unitarian Universalist Association. “The votes definitely matter,” he said. CalPERS investment director Simiso Nzima said CEO pay design would improve if other big investors voted more critically. Verwandte ThemenBiggest U.S. index funds oppose most climate proposals in shareholder votes“Talking to companies behind the scenes on this particular issue is a bit like trying to boil the ocean,” Nzima said. ‘EXCESSIVELY DEFERENTIAL’ Few foresaw an investing revolution when Jack Bogle of Vanguard introduced the first index fund, now called the Vanguard 500 fund, in 1976. Rather than trying to beat the market, Bogle simply sought to match it - while chopping fees to investors. Bogle, who died in January, often recalled how early index funds were disparaged as mediocre, even called “un-American.” After the 2008 financial crisis whipsawed retirement account balances, many investors stopped trying to beat the market and embraced the lower fees of passive funds. At the end of August, passive U.S. stock funds managed $4.27 trillion - up from less than $1 trillion before the crisis, and slightly more than the $4.25 trillion in actively managed U.S. stock funds, according to research firm Morningstar Inc. Challenging company management in proxy votes creates adversarial relationships that do not serve the business interests of the index funds, Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard University corporate governance scholar, wrote in a May research paper. The index fund firms are “excessively deferential” to the managers of their portfolio companies, he wrote, because that approach better serves their corporate mission to grow their assets-under-management - and the fees that come with managing those assets. Bebchuk and several other academics say the index fund providers do not want to rankle senior management at publicly traded U.S. corporations because they also want to make money selling index funds to their employees through company retirement plans. Effectively monitoring the thousands of firms in stock-market indexes would also require considerable staff and resources with little tangible payoff to an index fund’s bottom line. Because the funds all own the same stocks – under formulas calibrated to track a broad index – they can’t compete with one another on market performance. Instead, they compete with aggressive discounting of fees. Those low costs are also the biggest selling point of all index funds over their actively managed competitors, which must charge more to pay for teams of managers who constantly research companies and cull low performers from their portfolios.Index funds’ business model and cost pressures don’t allow for much company research, said Ron Gilson, a professor at the law schools of Columbia University and Stanford University who follows the industry. “There’s not much room for them to be investing in stewardship, particularly when real stewardship is expensive and you’re charging some customers close to a zero management fee,” Gilson said in an interview. BlackRock, for instance, has 45 people on its team that handles proxy votes, according to a company report in August. The votes cover about 16,000 corporate meetings per year. Last year, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA) moved about $10 billion in equity index assets into accounts that would allow the retirement plan to take over proxy voting – and take it away from external portfolio managers including BlackRock, according to publicly available meeting minutes. With expanded voting power, LACERA’s support for management proposals dropped to 80% in 2018 from 93% the previous year, when BlackRock had more sway, according to LACERA board presentations. Support for shareholder proposals rose to 74% in 2018, up from 56% support in 2017. LACERA declined to comment. BACKING EXECUTIVE PAY During the 2018 proxy season, top index fund providers supported corporate leaders through some trying times for shareholders of the companies in the bottom 10% of the Russell 3000 index. The three funds’ backing of a big raise for PG&E chief executive Geisha Williams - to $8.6 million in 2018 from $4.2 million the year before - came after the company suspended its dividend. The executive pay package received overwhelming support from other investors, even though a stable dividend is a key reason for owning utility stocks. PG&E stock lost a quarter of its value in 2017. The utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after severe wildfires in 2017 and 2018 resulted in more than $30 billion in liabilities amid investigations into whether the utility’s equipment had caused the blazes. When the index fund companies helped defeat the proposal to split the chairman and CEO roles at GE in 2018, their huge stakes in the company allowed them collectively to cast 1.3 billion votes against the measure out of a total of 2.8 billion votes in opposition. Investors supporting the measure cast nearly 2 billion votes in favor, hoping to curb the power of GE’s CEO in the boardroom. In November 2017, the three index fund firms unanimously backed the pay packages at beauty products company Coty Inc, one of the worst performers in the Russell 3000 index after losing 72% of its value in the three years ended in 2018. The nearly $500,000 in tuition payments for executives’ children – an unusual perk – came as part of pay packages that ranged from $3 million to $12 million. The Florida State Board of Administration was one of the few dissenters to vote against Coty’s pay arrangements. The large index funds also backed the re-election of Coty Chairman Lambertus Becht, who received a special $3.6 million payout for his work on the company’s $12.5 billion acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty business in 2016. Top proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services said Becht’s total compensation of $4.6 million “significantly exceeds market norms for non-employee director pay.” Other major investors voted in favor of Becht’s re-election, but some dumped Coty’s stock as it struggled to digest the acquisition. Spokespeople for PG&E, General Electric and Coty declined to comment for this story. It’s rare in proxy voting for a majority of investors in a company to oppose executive pay packages. Even in such cases, BlackRock usually supports management. In 2018, among the 57 companies in the Russell 3000 that failed to win a majority of investor support for their pay plans, BlackRock sided with management about 60% of the time, according to consulting firm Semler Brossy and company voting records. BlackRock supported rich pay packages for directors at Clovis Oncology, who each earned about $500,000 a year despite the firm’s modest market capitalization of $1.4 billion. That’s twice the typical pay of directors at the 500 largest U.S. companies by revenue, according to Equilar. Vanguard and State Street sided against BlackRock. In all, 58% of votes cast were against a proposal to ratify director pay. Clovis, which declined to comment, responded by cutting director pay by one-quarter after taking into account the low support and investor feedback, the company said in its 2019 proxy. Switch Inc CEO Rob Roy received nearly $100 million in compensation in 2017 when he took the Las Vegas-based data center operator public. The following year, BlackRock backed the election of three directors on Switch’s compensation committee who had awarded Roy his big pay package. State Street backed two of them. Vanguard voted against all three on the compensation committee. “The awards are unusual, and the complete lack of performance-vesting criteria heightens concern,” proxy advisory firm ISS wrote in a May 2018 research report. Each of the three Switch directors received 97% of votes cast. Switch shares lost about two-thirds of their value in the 15 months after its October 2017 initial public offering. Switch and CEO Roy declined to comment. ALL ABOARD FOR AN $84 MILLION PAYOUT In one case, BlackRock noted concerns about a big payout to an executive but voted for it anyway. In February 2017, legendary railroad executive Hunter Harrison demanded $84 million in upfront money to join CSX Corp as CEO. BlackRock balked at the size of the payment and cited investor concerns about Harrison’s health, according to a June 2017 BlackRock report on proxy voting. Before investors voted on his pay package, a Wall Street Journal story detailed how an undisclosed medical condition forced Harrison to work from home, breathing with the help of an oxygen machine. BlackRock, which owned a 6% stake in the rail firm, put aside its concerns and supported the pay package, which received 93% support from all investors. Vanguard, with a 7% stake, and State Street, with around 4%, also voted in favor. Several months later, in December 2017, Harrison died. CSX adopted a rule requiring its next CEO to submit to a physical examination. The resolution that prompted that change at CSX was filed by Virginia attorney John Fishwick Jr., and it was adopted by the company before any vote. He said he was surprised none of the big fund managers stepped up with their own proposal. CSX declined to comment on Harrison’s pay.

88,Powerhouse U.S. cities home to worst wage inequality,"Wage inequality has soared in many of the United States' biggest cities over the past 35 years as companies cluster in urban centers, driving big paychecks for in-demand workers, according to a report by the New York Federal Reserve here FILE PHOTO: People walk along Wall Street during the morning commute in the financial district during a winter nor'easter in New York City, U.S., March 2, 2018. REUTERS/Andrew KellyAt the same time, a broad swath of Americans in the very same cities is being left behind, with wage increases for low- to middle-wage employees failing to keep pace with the dramatic gains by high-end workers. Cities such as New York, Houston and San Francisco have moved to near the top of the rankings in recent years in terms of wage inequality, the report by economists Jaison Abel and Richard Deitz released on Monday found. In San Francisco, inflation-adjusted wages for workers in the top 5% of wage earners grew by 120% between 1980 and 2015, while wages for the bottom 10% of earners grew by just 20%. In New York City, wages grew by 110% for the top 5% of workers, but just 15% for the bottom 10%, according to the report. Economic inequality has been rising across the United States as globalization and automation eliminate some middle-income jobs and highly skilled workers in technology, finance and other sectors win higher wage premiums. The changes are making city life more challenging for lower wage workers, who are struggling to keep up with rising housing costs and other bills. “For people in these lower paid occupations, it’s less appealing,” said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed Hire Lab. “There are fewer opportunities.” (GRAPHIC - U.S. cities with the worst wage inequality: here) UNEQUAL GROWTH Cities with “sluggish economies” tended to have weaker wage gains for all workers, but also lower levels of inequality than larger cities, the researchers found.  This is especially true in cities where the main industries are struggling financially, like Detroit, where automation and auto plant closures have led to job losses.   While areas such as the thriving tech sector in the San Francisco-San Jose region have moved up the rankings, some cities with the most or least inequality in 1980 were still marked by extremes 35 years later.  Fairfield, Connecticut, about 50 miles northeast of New York City and home to General Electric’s headquarters from the 1970s until 2016, had the starkest wage gap between rich and poor in both 1980 and in 2015. The disparity, however, has become more dramatic. In 1980, a Fairfield resident with earnings in the top 10% made nearly six times as much as a neighbor in the bottom 10%. By 2015, those on the high end earned nine times as much. Bakersfield and Santa Cruz in California also had persistently high levels of inequality, the report found. At the other end of the spectrum, cities such as Erie, Pennsylvania, Utica-Rome, New York, and Sheboygan, Wisconsin, had some of the lowest levels of inequality.  Lower wage workers have less leverage than they did in previous generations because unions are weaker now, said Josh Bivens, research director for the Economic Policy Institute. Long periods of high unemployment have also limited workers’ ability to push for better pay, he said.  “In the last 30 years, lots of those things that provided wage growth for low- and moderate-wage workers have been stripped away,” Bivens said.  Recent trends in the labor market may provide some relief,he said. Some states and cities have approved minimum wage increases in the past couple of years, while a tight labor market has also helped to create better opportunities for some low and middle wage workers. But those improvements are likely not enough to close the gap, Bivens said. ",Inlandsnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters
89,U.S. Supreme Court takes major case that could curb abortion access,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to take up a major abortion case that could lead to new curbs on access to the procedure as it considers the legality of a Republican-backed Louisiana law that imposes restrictions on abortion doctors. The justices will hear an appeal by abortion provider Hope Medical Group for Women, which sued to try to block the law, of a lower court ruling upholding the measure. The Shreveport-based Hope Medical Group said implementation of the law would prompt the closure of two of the state’s three abortion clinics. The court will also hear a separate appeal by the state arguing that the abortion clinic lacks the legal standing to sue. The law includes a requirement that doctors who perform abortions have a difficult-to-obtain arrangement called “admitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the abortion clinic.  The court begins its new nine-month term on Monday. A ruling in the case is due by the end of June. The Louisiana law was passed in 2014 but courts have prevented it from taking effect. The Supreme Court struck down a similar Texas requirement in 2016 when conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy joined the four liberal justices to defend abortion rights, but Kennedy retired in 2018 and Republican President Donald Trump replaced him with conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as the court has moved further to the right. The case will test the willingness of the court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority that includes two Trump appointees, to uphold Republican-backed abortion restrictions being pursued in numerous conservative states. Anti-abortion activists are hoping the court will scale back or even overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. Trump vowed during the 2016 presidential campaign to appoint justices who would overturn that landmark ruling. “I’m hoping the Supreme Court will see this law for exactly what it is: an unconstitutional burden on our fundamental rights,” said Kathaleen Pittman, who runs the Hope clinic. “We are counting on the court to follow its precedent, otherwise clinics will needlessly close and there will be just one doctor left in the entire state to provide abortion care,” added Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the clinics.  Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican, said in a statement the law is needed because of what he called poor medical standards at abortion clinics. “Incompetent and unsafe providers should not be allowed to challenge health and safety standards designed to protect women from those very providers,” Landry added. FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Supreme Court is seen in Washington, U.S., June 11, 2018. REUTERS/Erin Schaff/File Photo‘THE BEST INTEREST OF WOMEN’ “Abortion activists are more than willing to lower the bar on women’s health in order to expand abortion, but stricter clinic regulations are in the best interest of women,” said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, which opposes abortion. Abortion rights advocates have argued that restrictions such as requiring admitting privileges for doctors are meant to limit access to abortion, not protect women’s health.  The Supreme Court will review a September 2018 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld the Louisiana law. The court in February on a 5-4 vote prevented the law from going into effect while litigation over its legality continued. The justices on Friday took no action on another abortion-related case concerning the state of Indiana’s effort to revive an abortion-related law requiring women to have an ultrasound 18 hours before having an abortion. Abortion rights advocates have argued that such an ultrasound is medically unnecessary and intended to dissuade a women from having an abortion. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court’s four liberals in the majority when it blocked the law from going into effect.  A federal district judge struck down Louisiana’s law in January 2016, saying it created an impermissible undue burden on a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion under existing Supreme Court precedent. The appeals court revived the law, saying there was no evidence any clinics in Louisiana would close as a result of the “admitting privileges” requirement. The high court legalized abortion nationwide in 1973 and reaffirmed it in 1992 in a ruling that disallowed abortion laws that placed an “undue burden” on a woman’s ability to obtain an abortion. “An undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability,” the court wrote in the 1992 ruling. Since Kavanaugh joined the court last October, it has sent mixed signals on abortion. The court in June declined to hear a bid by Alabama to revive a Republican-enacted law that would have effectively banned abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. In May, it refused to consider reinstating Indiana’s ban on abortions performed because of fetal disability or the sex or race of the fetus while upholding the state’s requirement that fetal remains be buried or cremated after an abortion.

90,Trump administration rejects new protections for iconic Alaska tree,"An iconic Alaska tree that is dying off from rising forest temperatures and diminished winter snowpack was deemed ineligible by U.S. wildlife officials on Friday for special protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The Trump administration, though acknowledging that climate change is a factor in the decline of the yellow-cedar, rejected a petition to list the tree as a threatened species under the landmark environmental law.  The trees, which can grow to be more than 1,000 years old, are mostly found in the coastal temperate rain forests of southeastern Alaska and British Columbia, though some stands occur as far south as northern California.  Environmentalists seeking the threatened species listing were trying to secure new safeguards for the trees in Alaska, where a long-running die-off extending across more than 1,500 square miles is concentrated. A 2016 University of Alaska-led study found at least 70% of the trees had been lost in the hardest-hit areas. Scientists blame the die-off on human-caused climate change, stemming from rising levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere. Warmer-then-normal temperatures have converted much of winter’s precipitation from snow to rain in southeastern Alaska, ironically exposing yellow-cedar’s shallow roots to freeze damage from soil less insulated by snowpack, scientists say. But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has jurisdiction over Endangered Species Act protections for plants as well as animals, determined that the die-off is not widespread enough to justify a threatened listing. The yellow-cedar decline likely peaked in the 1970s and 1980s, and the current status of the die-off affects only 6% of the species’ range, the Fish and Wildlife Service said in a statement. “Therefore, it is not having population level effects on the species,” the service said. Larry Edwards of Alaska Rainforest Defenders said the decision misses the long-term picture. “It’s not just the concern about the present but looking ahead, as the climate continues to warm,” Edwards said. The die-off has become an obvious part of the landscape. “You see stands of dead stems on the mountainsides,” said Edwards, who lives in Sitka. “If you go up and look, those stems are yellow-cedar.” The yellow-cedar, actually a type of cypress and not a cedar, is prized for its high-value timber and its significance to indigenous cultures of the Pacific Northwest. Denial of the yellow-cedar listing proposal comes as the Trump administration is seeking to expand logging in southeast Alaska’s Tongass National Forest and to revise Endangered Species Act rules in a way that environmentalists say will weaken protections under the law. The yellow-cedars could benefit instead from selective logging that thins the forest, planting of seedlings and development of a new browse-resistant strain “that would make seedlings less palatable to deer,” the Fish and Wildlife Service said in a statement. The yellow-cedar was one of a dozen imperiled plants and animals for whom Endangered Species Act petitions were denied on Friday, including the Berry Cave salamander in eastern Tennessee, the Panamint alligator lizard in California and the Southern hognose snake in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. The Trump administration has now declined protection for 74 species and granted safeguards to 18, the fewest of any president at this point in an administration, according to the Center for Biological Diversity.

91,Warren's campaign fires senior staff member for 'inappropriate conduct',"U.S. presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren’s campaign has fired a senior staff member following complaints of “inappropriate behavior,” a campaign spokeswoman said on Friday. Kristen Orthman said the campaign’s leadership had received multiple complaints over the past two weeks about Richard McDaniel, Warren’s national organizing director, and hired outside counsel to investigate.  “The campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,” Orthman said in an emailed statement.  Orthman did not give details about the nature of the complaints against McDaniel. His firing was first reported by Politico. McDaniel said in a statement that he would never intentionally engage in behavior “inconsistent” with his own values or those of Warren’s campaign. “If others feel that I have, I understand it is important to listen even when you disagree,” he said, confirming he was no longer on the campaign team. Warren’s campaign to win the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential contest has been gaining ground in recent weeks.  She has been rising in public opinion polls, and earlier on Friday she reported an increase in fundraising between July and September. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, last week edged past former Vice President Joe Biden for the first time in a major national opinion poll. ",Politik,2019-10-04 00:00:00,Reuters

96,"Hong Kong leader Lam does not rule out Beijing help, as economy suffers","Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday did not rule out asking Beijing for help, as the Asian financial hub struggles to deal with months of often violent anti-government protests that are damaging its economy. Lam said Beijing wanted Hong Kong to solve its own problems, but under its mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, Hong Kong could ask Beijing for help. “If the situation becomes so bad, then no options could be ruled out, if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance,” Lam said at weekly news conference after a long weekend of violence crippled the city. “But at this moment, I and my team, we are still very committed in making sure we can use our own instruments ... to try and restore calm and order in Hong Kong,” she said, adding there were no plans to expand emergency laws introduced on Friday. “But I would appeal (to) everyone in society to join hands to achieve this objective.” The protests, which show no sign of abating, pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012 and are Hong Kong’s thorniest political crisis since Britain returned it to China in 1997. Lam said protests were severely damaging the economy. “Hong Kong’s various sectors will enter a severe winter season,” she said. Tens of thousands of protesters, many families with children, took to the streets of Hong Kong over the weekend wearing face masks in defiance of colonial-era emergency laws invoked on Friday which ban masks at public rallies. Protesters use masks to shield their identities. But the rallies, which started out peaceful, spiraled into some of the most violent clashes since protests started four months ago, forcing the unprecedented shutdown of the city’s metro after stations were torched. YOUNG DEMONSTRATORS ARRESTED Police said on Tuesday 77 people had been arrested for violating the anti-mask law, including a 12-year-old. Since September nearly 40% of those arrested in protests were under 18 and 10% under 15, said Lam, adding young people should not be involved in political activity. Two teenagers have been shot and wounded in skirmishes with police and scores of people and police have been injured. Authorities have described protesters as “militant activists”, but many Hong Kong residents are also angry at the emergency powers, fearing their civil rights could be eroded. On Tuesday, hundreds of school and university students attended class wearing masks in protest at the emergency law.

Sunday also saw the first interaction between protesters and Chinese troops stationed in the territory. Protesters targeted a military barracks with lasers prompting troops to hoist a banner warning they could be arrested. Senior People’s Liberation Army officers have said violence will not be tolerated. ‘CHALLENGE TO STABILITY’ What started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing’s tightening grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a “one country, two systems” formula promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule. China dismisses such accusations, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday anything bad happening in Hong Kong would be bad for U.S.-China trade talks. The protests have threatened to entangle global businesses that have alluded to the turmoil in publicity material, including U.S. luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co and sports brand Vans. Chinese state television said it would not air NBA exhibition games played in the country this week after a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive backing the protests. “In our opinion, any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability, should not be regarded as a freedom of expression,” CCTV said. China’s Oct. 1 National Day holiday week is normally a time when Hong Kong is flooded with visitors, but many shops were closed and tourist numbers plummeted 50%, said Lam, warning the city’s third quarter economic data would “surely be very bad”. The territory is facing its first recession in a decade. Hong Kong’s metro, which normally carries some 5 million people daily, was only partially operating on Tuesday. Scores of shops were closed and many bank cash machines were vandalized. Lam appealed to property developers and landlords to offer relief to retailers whose businesses had been hit. The last British governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten has warned someone could be killed if Lam does not engage in dialogue and has joined protesters in calling for an independent inquiry into accusations of excessive force by police.

Young women are seen outside a Vans store at a shopping center in Beijing, China October 8, 2019. REUTERS/Jason LeeGlobal companies are walking a tightrope in their marketing campaigns, fearing a backlash from Chinese customers if deemed to be expressing solidarity with the anti-government protests that have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis in decades. The U.S. luxury jewellery retailer Tiffany & Co deleted a Twitter advertisement posted on Monday showing a female model with her hand covering her right eye, which some people interpreted as supporting the protesters. A female medic was hospitalized after being hit by a pellet in the eye during protests in August. She became a symbol for what protesters say is excessive police force. In an emailed response to Reuters, Tiffany spokesman Nathan Strauss said the campaign image was photographed in May and was not intended to be a political statement of any kind.  “We regret that it may be perceived as such, and in turn have removed the image from our digital and social media channels and will discontinue its use effective immediately,” Strauss said.  Vans last week invited the public to vote for their favorite sneaker design from more than 100,000 submissions from around the world in a Vans Global Custom Culture competition. Media reported that a design from a Canada-based competitor named Naomiso won the online vote before it was taken down on Saturday.  RAISING PRESSURE The design featured a red bauhinia, a flower that symbolizes Hong Kong and is on its flag, and a yellow umbrella, a nod to 2014 protests that some refer to as the umbrella revolution. A group of people wearing helmets, masks and goggles can be seen on the side of the sneaker design.  “Based on the global competitions guidelines, Vans can confirm that a small number of artistic submissions have been removed. This decision was taken to uphold the purpose of Custom Culture,” Vans, a unit of VF Corp, said in a Facebook statement. Vans did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday. A search of the username Naomiso on the Custom Culture’s website did not yield any result on Tuesday. Some people in Hong Kong have called for a boycott of the sneaker brand on Facebook while some retailers have suspended sales of Vans products. “Starting from today, every branch of our company will suspend sales of all Vans products,” said Search Sneaker Shop, one of the best-known sneaker stores in Hong Kong, in a Facebook post on Saturday. However, mainland Chinese users on the Weibo social media platform praised Vans for getting rid of the design, after being enraged by it at first.

99,"Asked about Bidens, China says doesn't intend intervening in U.S. affairs","The Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday that China had no intention of intervening in U.S. domestic affairs when asked about U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that Beijing investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son. The Republican president, the subject of an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. Congress for asking Ukraine’s president to investigate the Bidens, last week suggested that Beijing “start an investigation” into the 2020 presidential hopeful and his son Hunter, who had business interests in China.  Trump has said Biden and his son are “corrupt” but has shown no evidence to back that up.  “China has always pursued non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing.  “We have no intention of intervening in the United States. Our position has remained consistent and clear on this,” Geng said without elaborating.   Trump’s appeal to China was particularly striking as the two countries are set to hold another round of talks in the United States this week to resolve a bitter trade war. Questioned about whether he had asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to look into the Bidens, Trump told reporters on Thursday: “I haven’t, but it’s certainly something we can start thinking about.” Trump’s remarks on China have also stiffened the resolve of Democrats in the House of Representatives to push ahead with an inquiry into whether he should be impeached following revelations by an anonymous whistleblower who said Trump asked Ukraine in July to investigate the Bidens. Trump froze $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine shortly before speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy,  prompting accusations from Democrats that he had misused U.S. foreign policy for personal gain. Trump has described the impeachment probe as “crap”. Some Republicans have criticized Biden for taking his son on the Air Force Two vice presidential plane in 2013 to China, a trip that came months after Hunter became an unpaid board member of a new investment fund with a Chinese private equity manager.  Hunter Biden has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.  The younger Biden was also on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at a time when the United States and Europe were trying to woo Ukraine away from next-door-neighbor Russia.

Russia, a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has emerged as a leading power broker in Syria over more than eight years of civil war and has said that Syria’s territorial integrity must be respected by all outside powers.  Turkey said earlier on Tuesday that it had finished preparing for a military operation in northeast Syria after Washington began withdrawing its troops. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had not been given advance warning.  “No, no one notified (us),” he told reporters on a conference call.

102,Trump says he won't tie Biden concerns to trade deal with China,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would not tie a much-anticipated trade deal with China to his publicly stated desire for Beijing to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election.  Speaking to reporters before departing the White House, Trump said negotiations to end the U.S. trade war with China were separate from any investigation into Biden, who Trump has accused of foreign corruption.  “One thing has nothing to do with the other,” the Republican president said when asked whether he would be more likely to make a deal with China if it investigated Biden. “I want to do a trade deal with China, but only if it’s good for our country.” On Thursday Trump publicly urged Beijing to investigate Biden, a Democrat, again raising concerns that he has invited foreign interference in the U.S. presidential election. Last week Trump released a transcript of a call where he asked Ukraine’s president to also look into Biden, a request that has triggered a congressional inquiry into whether he should be impeached.  Trump confirmed on Friday he would send a letter to House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi requesting that the chamber hold a full vote to formally approve the inquiry, a move that could slow the process down.

Hunter Biden also became a lawyer, but instead of public service, he went to work for MBNA, which at the time was one of the largest employers in Delaware, a credit-card company that hired him for a lucrative in-house job. He would later become a Washington lobbyist, where his clients included universities and tech companies, like the now-defunct Napster. He stopped lobbying when his father got elected vice president in 2008. Trump points to Hunter Biden’s role after he left lobbying, when he started a consulting shop meant to help foreign companies, and his work in China and Ukraine while his father was vice president under Democratic President Barack Obama. On Thursday, Trump upped the pressure, publicly calling on Beijing and Kiev to launch investigations into Hunter Biden’s work - repeating accusations of corruption he has made with no evidence. It was Trump’s July call with Ukraine’s president urging that country to investigate the Bidens that prompted Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. The president’s call on Thursday for China to investigate came only moments after discussing how he could exert pressure on that nation to approve a trade deal.  PROMINENT RIVAL Joe Biden not only leads most opinion polls among the 19 Democrats seeking their party’s presidential nomination but also bests Trump in several polls measuring a hypothetical matchup in November 2020. His standing in the polls, he argues, is what is provoking Trump to levy increasingly aggressive and public attacks against both him and his son.      The Biden campaign accused Trump of abuse of power on Thursday following the president’s suggestion that China investigate Biden, but did not mention Hunter in the statement. It did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  But the turmoil has  brought to the forefront the personal details of Hunter Biden’s life that can easily be assumed he would have rather remained private.  In an interview with The New Yorker magazine earlier this year, Hunter Biden detailed his repeated attempts to kick a drug and alcohol addiction.

105,UK tells Turkey unilateral military action must be avoided,"Britain warned Turkey on Tuesday against taking unilateral military action in Syria, after the United States began pulling back troops from the border there. “We have been consistently clear with Turkey that unilateral military action must be avoided as it would destabilize the region and threaten efforts to secure the lasting defeat of Daesh (Islamic State),” foreign office minister Andrew Murrison said. Murrison also distanced the government from U.S. President Donald Trump’s earlier assertion that Britain was thrilled at his decision to withdraw troops.  Murrison said he had “no idea” where that comment came from and that it certainly was not based on the contents of a call between British foreign minister Dominic Raab and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday.

106,UK has not seen compromise from EU so far: PM Johnson's spokesman,"Britain has not seen compromise from the European Union so far in Brexit talks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said on Tuesday, calling on the bloc to be flexible to reach an exit deal. The spokesman said Johnson told his top team of ministers that Britain still wanted a deal and technical talks between British and EU officials were ongoing.  Earlier on Tuesday, the EU accused Britain of playing a “stupid blame game” over Brexit after a Downing Street source said a deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands. The spokesman said the talks were obviously at a critical point. “The PM does want a deal, but if we are to achieve that, it is going to require some compromise from the EU, and that is not something that we have seen so far,” the spokesman said, adding that it was not Britain that was talking about blame games.

107,Biggest U.S. index funds oppose most climate proposals in shareholder votes,"The far-reaching impacts of climate change on companies have investors pressing corporate leaders for action to minimize environmental damage and to maximize disclosure of risks to their businesses. The threats range from more frequent floods or wildfires that imperil major assets to regulations that could undermine profits. While votes on climate-related shareholder resolutions often take center stage at corporate annual meetings, they seldom draw support from the two top U.S. index fund firms, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group. The reticence of the two largest index fund providers to back these proposals draws criticism from some investors and climate activists.  BlackRock sometimes criticizes the quality of the climate-change proposals offered by others, but the world’s largest money manager and its top rivals have not put forward any proposals of their own since at least 2001, according to research firm FactSet. “The investors who should be the leaders have so far been the laggards,” said Rob Berridge, director of shareholder engagement at Ceres, a Boston-based research and advocacy group focused on sustainability issues. Their limited support for other shareholders’ climate-related proposals highlights a broader pattern of deference to management at the companies in their stock portfolios, according to a Reuters analysis of their proxy voting records.  Ahead of shareholder meetings in 2017, investors led by Walden Asset Management filed resolutions with Blackrock and Vanguard calling for reviews of their proxy voting related to climate change. Walden later withdrew the resolutions after BlackRock and Vanguard each pledged to put a new focus on climate risks. But in 2018, BlackRock and Vanguard only backed 10% and 12%, respectively, of climate-related shareholder resolutions, according to a count by Ceres. A Reuters review of proxy voting disclosures for the 2019 proxy season ended June 30 found similar rates of support by each manager for key votes tracked by Ceres this year.  Those rates were less than Walden and other investors expected given the companies’ pledges to take the issue more seriously, said Tim Smith, a director at the firm now known as Boston Trust Walden, a money manager focused on environmental and social issues. The top index fund firms say they prefer to address issues they have with portfolio companies, including those related to climate change, in private talks with executives rather than through shareholder votes. Vanguard governance chief Glenn Booraem said such votes don’t tell the whole story of its advocacy on climate issues. In an August report, Vanguard said it had met often with companies in carbon-intensive industries over the past year and discussed issues such as environmental risks and their impact on shareholder value.  Vanguard and BlackRock both declined to discuss their votes on specific proxy measures. They note their own investors hold a wide range of opinions on climate change. BlackRock told a large Seattle pension plan client in 2018 that it often finds shareholder proposals too prescriptive, immaterial or in the domain of a company’s leadership. “We typically aim to understand the companies rather than use our vote as a blunt binary instrument,” BlackRock said in response to due diligence questions from the Seattle City Employees’ Retirement System (SCERS). The third largest index fund manager, State Street Corp (STT.N), supported the resolutions tracked by Ceres 34% of the time in 2018. The rate was about three times as often as its big index fund rivals and similar to the support rate of other big investors such as Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) and Franklin Templeton, part of Franklin Resources Inc (BEN.N).  State Street spokeswoman Olivia Offner declined to discuss individual votes but said in a statement that companies have responded to its concerns on issues including “improved disclosure on their sustainability practices.” Some clients say BlackRock and Vanguard effectively press their concerns privately. They also cite efforts like the annual letter that BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink sends to other CEOs, in which he has raised topics including how environmental and social issues affect corporate valuations.  “There’s always room for improvement, but they’re taking it seriously and doing a much more proactive job” of pressuring companies on climate and other issues, said Vermont Chief Investment Officer Eric Henry, speaking about top index fund firms. He oversees about $4.5 billion, including assets managed by BlackRock. Walden’s Smith acknowledged that private pressure can work but said the major index funds need to vote critically to reinforce their message. “The problem is we have no insight into what’s said in those meetings,” he said. “You don’t know whether they soft-pedal it.”  In late 2016, the $3 billion SCERS pension publicly rebuked BlackRock - which managed about $350 million of the system’s investments - for its “reticence to oppose management, limited focus on environmental and social issues, inconsistency between their proxy voting record with their policies and public pronouncements and limited transparency on investment stewardship activities,” as an official put it at a board meeting. Officials at the plan put BlackRock on watch status, which could have led to it being dropped as an investment manager. Two years later, in December 2018, the Seattle system ended its review and kept its money with Blackrock, with a staff memo noting among other things the asset manager had voted to support a few climate risk resolutions in 2017 and 2018. Of 25 climate risk shareholder proposals in the 2018 proxy year, the company voted in favor of two, BlackRock told the Seattle retirement system in a letter reviewed by Reuters. The Seattle system’s staff also noted that BlackRock had started providing some details on its engagements with companies behind closed doors. “Yet to assess the efficacy of these engagements, BlackRock must continue to increase its transparency,” the memo states. Ceres found that other big mutual fund companies have backed climate-related shareholder proposals at much higher rates. AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB.N) and Eaton Vance Corp (EV.N), for instance, supported climate-related proposals 88 percent and 85 percent of the time, respectively.

To match Special Report USA-FUNDS/INDEX-CLIMATECHANGE   REUTERS/Jonathan BachmanBlackrock’s hesitance to back climate-related shareholder proposals contrasts with warnings it has raised about financial impacts on businesses from climate concerns. Earlier this year, for example, the BlackRock Investment Institute warned investors in commercial real estate, municipal bonds and utility companies that the value of those assets could tumble because of climate-change impacts.  Aging infrastructure and older design standards, for example, leave assets at publicly traded utility companies vulnerable to extreme weather events such as wildfires and hurricanes, the institute said in an April report. The report followed California utility PG&E Corp’s (PCG.N) declaration of bankruptcy in January, after its market value plummeted as the company’s equipment was blamed for wildfires in California.

108,Syrian Kurdish official eyes possible talks with Damascus,"The Kurdish-led authorities in northern Syria may open talks with Damascus and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Turkish border area, a Syrian Kurdish official said on Tuesday. Badran Jia Kurd’s comments to Reuters reflect the predicament facing Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria following a partial withdrawal of U.S. troops who have effectively shielded the area from Turkish attack. The United States withdrew 50 American special forces from a section of the Turkish border on Monday, opening the way for Turkey to stage a long-threatened incursion against Syrian Kurdish-led forces that it deems as terrorists. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has described the U.S. decision as “a stab in the back”. Spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, the SDF has been a major part of the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State. “If America vacates the area and especially the border area for certain we, as a self administration and as the SDF, will be forced to study all the available options,” Jia Kurd told Reuters. “At that time we may hold talks with Damascus or the Russian side to fill the void or block the Turkish attack, so this may develop and there could be meetings and contacts in case of a vacuum,” he said. Turkey said on Tuesday it had completed preparations for a military operation in the northeast. It views the YPG as a terrorist organization because of its links to Kurdish militants who have waged a long insurgency in Turkey. The Kurdish-led administration found itself in a similar position in late 2018 when President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria. The SDF held talks in Damascus that broke down without progress. Despite enmity between Syrian Kurds and Damascus, the result of years of systematic persecution of Kurds under the rule of the Baathist government, the dominant Syrian Kurdish groups have seldom fought the Syrian government during the war. While the Syrian rebellion has fought to topple President Bashar al-Assad, the YPG says its priority is to maintain regional autonomy as part of the Syrian state. Damascus however is loathe to cede the Kurds the level of autonomy they seek. The government earlier this year threatened the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces with military defeat if they did not agree to a return of state authority.     ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters

110,Hong Kong bourse pulls plug on $39 billion play for London Stock Exchange,"Hong Kong’s bourse has scrapped its unsolicited $39 billion approach for London Stock Exchange Group (LSE.L) after failing to convince LSE management and investors to back a move that could have transformed both global financial services giants. Last month’s surprise cash-and-shares approach threatened to upend the LSE’s $27 billion plan to buy data and analytics firm Refinitiv. The Hong Kong exchange had said the LSE would have to ditch the Refinitiv deal for its offer to go ahead. LSE shares slid 6% by 0848 GMT, close to their lowest since Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) (0388.HK) announced its approach on Sept. 11. Shares in the Hong Kong bourse were up 2.3% near the end of its trading day. HKEX chief executive Charles Li wrote in a blog post: “We still believe the strategic rationale for the combination of our two businesses is compelling and would create a world-leading market infrastructure group.”  “Despite a huge amount of work and discussions with a broad set of regulators and extensive shareholder discussions, the level of engagement from LSEG led us to conclude that the continued pursuit of a combination of the two businesses would not be in the best interests of our own shareholders,” he said. LSE said in a statement it remained “committed to and continues to make good progress on its proposed acquisition of Refinitiv”. Verwandte ThemenTimeline: LSE - A story of failed mega-mergersInvestors were due to vote on the Refinitiv deal next month and the transaction was expected to close in the second half of 2020, the LSE said, subject to regulatory approvals. Refinitiv is 45%-owned by Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO) which owns Reuters News.  SLIM CHANCE On the HKEK offer, one LSE investor told Reuters it would have been “very, very hard to get the LSE board to engage as they rebutted the offer on grounds of strategy, not price.” The investor spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Analysts had viewed HKEX’s chance of success as slim after it was rejected by the LSE just two days from the HKEX going public with its interest. Political turmoil engulfing Hong Kong and perceptions of Beijing’s growing influence over the city, were seen as another key obstacle to any deal.  Subsequent efforts by HKEX officials to engage with LSE shareholders had also met with resistance. Some investors told Reuters the HKEX would have to raise its offer by at least 20%, mostly in cash, to tempt LSE shareholders. “The price tag from the Hong Kong exchange perspective was getting a bit too high, so it’s good for the shareholders that they decided to walk away,” said Hao Hong, head of research at broker BOCOM International. FILE PHOTO: The name of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited is displayed at the entrance in Hong Kong, China January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File PhotoSince the HKEX announced its interest in mid-September, its shares had fallen 8%, compared with a 5% drop in the Hang Seng benchmark index. WHAT NEXT? The failure of the bold move leaves open the question of what Li might try next to fulfill the HKEX’s strategy of being “China-anchored and globally connected”. The HKEX has been the world’s largest capital-raising venue in five of the past 10 years, but has been working to diversify its equities focus, launching a bond trading platform with China and buying the London Metal Exchange in 2012 for 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion). “HKEX will continue to try other things. Charles Li has done a lot of deals, most notably the London Metal Exchange. It may not be a stock exchange, but other related areas,” said Bocom’s Hong. Under British takeover rules, the HKEX had until Oct. 9 to make a binding offer for LSE. The withdrawal of the approach means it cannot bid again for the LSE for at least six months unless the LSE’s management agreed to an offer, another group made a bid for the London exchange operator, or other events were deemed to be a material change in the LSE’s circumstances. “If the Refinitiv deal surprisingly fails to get approval, I think we could see HKEX come again,” said China Galaxy Securities analyst Chi Man Wong. “The (LSE) shareholder meeting (to approve the Refinitiv purchase) has been tentatively set for November but there is no firm date. If that deal fails then HKEX will be there.” FILE PHOTO: The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File PhotoAnalysts at Bank of America said investors had been worried that the HKEX’s pursuit of a deal could have led the exchange to raise fresh funds - weighing on the price of existing shares. “We think there may still be questions as to why HKEX proposed the acquisition when it seemed somewhat challenging to bring to fruition, but we believe investors will likely focus more on the fundamentals of the company and the market in Hong Kong,” they said in a research note.

112,"UK publishes update to no-deal Brexit plans, seeking to reassure businesses and voters","Britain sought on Tuesday to ease concerns about leaving the European Union without a deal, publishing a raft of contingency plans which included a new advice service to help suppliers of medical goods. With just 23 days before the United Kingdom is due to leave the bloc, the future of Brexit remains deeply uncertain and both London and Brussels are positioning themselves to avoid blame for a delay or a disorderly no-deal Brexit. Britain’s parliament, where a majority of lawmakers have tried to prevent a no-deal Brexit, has demanded an update on the government’s efforts to try to mitigate the disruption that leaving without a deal is expected to cause.  The government published an update to those plans on Tuesday in a 155-page document entitled “No-Deal Readiness Report” which covered steps taken on key issues like borders, citizens’ rights, energy, industry and Northern Ireland. “At every point, the government will be candid about the challenges ahead as well as clear-eyed about the opportunities,” said Michael Gove, the minister in charge of preparations. “Together, government, businesses and citizens can work to get ready for Brexit – and look forward to the future with confidence.” Previously leaked documents have highlighted the potential for civil unrest, and food, fuel and medicine shortages in the event of no-deal - although the government at the time said those represented an outdated worst-case scenario, which they have tried to address. Tuesday’s document, which largely covered previously announced contingency measures and advice to businesses and consumers, set out the establishment of a new “Support Unit” to help suppliers of medical goods prepare. “This will help to ensure that companies have the necessary customs paperwork in place for border arrangements ahead of Brexit on 31 October, if we leave without a deal,” the plans said. “These teams of specialists will be able to provide traders operating in the health and social care sector with up-to-date advice and practical guidance on the steps they need to take to prepare.” ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters

U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY)  speaks during a town hall in New York, U.S., October 3, 2019.  REUTERS/Lucas JacksonBut voters in a town hall also pressed her on the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, climate change and healthcare, enabling the first-term congresswoman to display her progressive credentials on a range of issues. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, has soared to prominence since her election a year ago, pushing the Democratic Party to veer to the left ahead of the November 2020 presidential election while becoming a favorite target of conservative Fox News and Republicans who consider her too radical. “If the government worked for us half as much as it works for billionaires and corporations, our lives would be transformed,” Ocasio-Cortez said before about 100 people at a public library in the borough of Queens. She outlined an agenda that may find a path through the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives but would be sure to fail in the Republican-led Senate. Her “Just Society” proposal, comprising five separate bills, offers plenty of ammunition for critics and admirers. It would overhaul federal guidelines on the poverty line, now defined as an individual earning less than $13,064 each year or a family of four earning less than $25,465. Ocasio-Cortez would identify far more people as impoverished and make them eligible for government benefits. Other bills would steer federal contracts to companies that treat workers well, curb rent hikes by landlords, or restore rights to former convicts after they have completed jail terms. One provision certain to spur supporters of Trump’s hardline immigration policies would extend federal benefits to undocumented immigrants. Ocasio-Cortez told reporters afterward she had yet to fix a price tag to the proposal, but said some provisions would cost nothing and others would cut spending, for example, by reducing the jail population and lowering the cost of incarceration. “This is a question that is only asked about the general welfare of the public and it’s not a question that we ask about war, it’s not a question that we ask about the $2.1-trillion GOP tax cut,” Ocasio-Cortez said.    “For those that may have a price tag attached to them, we’re happy to have that conversation,” she said, adding that the budget impact would be analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office.

117,"Beijing likely to pass on Trump invitation to probe Bidens, China experts say","If China were to act on U.S. President Donald Trump’s surprising request on Thursday to start an investigation into Democratic rival Joe Biden and his family, it would be breaking one of its stated rules: do not meddle in another nation’s internal politics.   Beijing also stands to gain little by helping Trump undermine a political opponent, even in the midst of a bitter trade war that China is eager to end, China experts say.   The Republican president, the subject of an impeachment inquiry in Congress for asking Ukraine’s president to investigate the Bidens, upped the ante by calling on China to “start an investigation” into 2020 presidential hopeful Biden and his businessman son Hunter. Beijing has a long-standing public policy of not interfering in foreign countries’ politics. Beijing does “not want to be involved or seen involved in the U.S. presidential elections,” said Jeffrey Bader, a former special assistant to President Barack Obama for national security and a top Asia advisor.   Wang Yi, the Chinese government’s top diplomat and foreign minister, said this repeatedly at events around the United Nations General Assembly last week.  “China will never interfere in the internal affairs of the United States, and we trust that the American people are capable of sorting out their own problems,” he said. Chinese officials could “try to hint at a potential exchange of policy concessions for information, if the information is damaging at all,” said Victor Shih, the Ho Miu Lam chair of China and Pacific Relations at University of California San Diego.  However, it might make more sense for Beijing to withhold any potentially negative information it may have on Trump’s rival  “in order not to increase Trump’s re-election chances,” Shih said. “After all, Trump has upset U.S.-China trade more than any president since Nixon,” he said.  Hunter traveled to China with his father, when the senior Biden was vice president, in 2013. The trip came months after Hunter became an unpaid board member of a new investment fund with a Chinese private equity manager, the New Yorker reported. Hunter Biden has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.   “The Chinese might be tempted to help Trump out and get a better trade deal, but I doubt they will interfere so directly in U.S. politics,” agreed Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the  Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They know the risks, which include betting on the wrong horse.”  MUDDYING TRADE TALKS       Trump’s request is also a recipe for bad trade policy, said trade experts. Officials from China and the United States will meet in Washington next week to try negotiate a truce in the trade war that’s resulted in billions of dollars in tariffs and threatens to slow global economic growth.  The president’s comments could be interpreted as an attempt to draw a link between trade talks and domestic politics, one person briefed on the trade talks said.  “Mingling our own domestic politics with legitimate concerns about China’s unfair trade practices is not a good avenue for getting a big deal done,” the person said. Over the course of the escalating trade war, Beijing officials have rarely responded to Trump’s volley of insults.    “The Chinese strategy to deal with Trump has been not to get drawn into tit-for-tat verbal battles, but pursue their interests in a very determined way, which is why the U.S.-China trade talks are continuing,” said Evan Medeiros, a professor at Georgetown University and former National Security Council official.  Trump’s public request is also probably a moot point, China experts add. Chinese officials likely already know absolutely  everything there is to know about Hunter Biden’s China-related activities or business dealings, thanks to Beijing’s long-standing practice of surveillance.  China’s Communist Party has historically monitored the activity of foreigners in the country closely, including restricting travel and visas, and sometimes communications and meetings with Chinese citizens and businesses.      One former U.S. official suggested that if Trump is serious about securing Chinese help in investigating the Bidens, he could try to entice them by promising greater U.S. cooperation in China’s efforts to secure the extradition of dozens of fugitives Beijing is seeking under its “Sky Net” anti-graft campaign.  Washington has long resisted handing over the fugitives, many of them accused of bribery, corruption and embezzlement, because of questions about the impartiality of China’s judicial system and the fairness of the charges.  The official said, however, that such an offer was unlikely to be enough to sway China to assist any probe targeting the Bidens. ",Politik,2019-10-03 00:00:00,Reuters
118,"S&P keeps Hong Kong's AA+ rating despite protests, cites strong finances","S&P maintained Hong Kong’s AA+ credit rating with a stable outlook on Tuesday despite increasingly violent anti-government protests, breaking with the other two big global credit rating agencies. The Chinese-ruled city’s “strong economic and financial metrics will allow the government’s credit standing to withstand the fallout from the ongoing social unrest,” S&P Global Ratings said in a news release. Growing violence on Hong Kong’s streets has added to pressure on the open economy from the protracted U.S.-China trade war, prompting Fitch Ratings to cut the city’s rating by a notch last month to AA, while Moody’s switched its outlook to  negative from stable but kept its Aa2 rating. Many analysts believe the city, one of the world’s most important trade and business hubs, has slid into its first recession in a decade. Tourism and retail sales have plummeted, threatening heavy job losses. S&P said near-term economic growth will be muted, but added that short-term stimulus measures will be implemented to support the flagging economy, with the government incurring fiscal deficits in the next one to two years. However, “abrupt changes” in Hong Kong’s relationship with the Chinese central government could sour this outlook, S&P said. Hong Kong is governed under the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ arrangement where the territory keeps its way of life upon returning to Chinese rule in 1997. Its autonomy, however, has been in doubt amid concerns over Beijing’s growing influence. ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters

127,Pentagon wasn't listening to Trump call with Ukraine's Zelenskiy,"No one from the U.S. Defense Department was listening to a July phone conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that is at the heart of a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry, the Pentagon said on Thursday. Democrats accuse Trump of using U.S. military aid as leverage in an attempt to enlist Ukraine’s help in investigating Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of the November 2020 election. The call, and who from the Trump administration was on it, as was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has become a matter of congressional interest. Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman told a news briefing that the department’s general counsel’s office has directed all pertinent Ukraine-related documents and records be provided for cataloguing and review. He noted congressional interest in a possible investigation by the Pentagon’s inspector general. House Democrats have launched a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. The Republican president, who denies any wrongdoing, asked his Ukrainian counterpart in a July phone call to investigate whether Biden, his predecessor Barack Obama’s vice president, had shut down an investigation into a gas company that employed his son Hunter. The call came after Trump ordered the government to freeze the military aid. He later lifted the freeze, and the Pentagon has resumed sending aid to Ukraine. In a separate briefing with reporters, the head of U.S. forces in Europe said he was in favor of sending additional Javelin antitank missiles to Ukraine. “Right now it is my military advice that I think we should go forward with that,” Air Force General Tod Wolters told reporters at the Pentagon, referring to the sale of additional Javelin missiles to Ukraine.  On Thursday, the State Department announced that it had approved the potential sale of 150 Javelin missiles to Ukraine. Ukraine is mired in a conflict with pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country. ",Politik,2019-10-03 00:00:00,Reuters
128,Trump woos seniors with order to boost Medicare health program,"U.S. President Donald Trump sought to woo seniors on Thursday with an executive order aimed at strengthening the Medicare health program by reducing regulations, curbing fraud, and providing faster access to new medical devices and therapies. U.S. President Donald Trump holds up an executive order on Medicare he signed during an event at The Villages retirement community in The Villages, Florida, U.S., October 3, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueThe order, which Trump discussed during a visit to a retirement community in Florida known as the Villages, is the Republican president’s answer to some Democrats who are pushing for a broad and expensive expansion of Medicare to cover all Americans. Trump referred to such proposals as socialist and pledged to prevent them from coming to fruition, a political promise with an eye toward his 2020 re-election campaign in which healthcare is likely to be a major issue. “They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing called socialism,” Trump told an enthusiastic crowd in Florida, a political swing state that is critical to his goal of keeping the White House. The executive order follows measures his administration rolled out in recent months designed to curtail drug prices and correct other perceived problems with the U.S. healthcare system. Policy experts say the efforts are unlikely to slow the tide of rising drug prices in a meaningful way. Trump suggested that drug companies were backing impeachment efforts in Washington, which he considers a “hoax,” as a way to sabotage his efforts to make prescriptions affordable.  “We’re lowering the cost of prescription drugs, taking on the pharmaceutical companies. And you think that’s easy? It’s not easy... I wouldn’t be surprised if the hoax didn’t come from some of the people that we’re taking on,” he said. Medicare covers Americans who are 65 and older and includes traditional fee-for-service coverage in which the government pays healthcare providers directly and Medicare Advantage plans, in which private insurers manage patient benefits on its behalf. Seniors are a key political constituency in America because a high percentage of them vote.  The order pushes for Medicare to use more medical telehealth services, which is care delivered by phone or digital means, leading to cost reductions by reducing expensive emergency room visits, an administration official told Reuters ahead of the announcement.  The order directs the government to work to allow private insurers that operate Medicare Advantage plans to use new plan pricing methods, such as allowing beneficiaries to share in the savings when they choose lower-cost health services. It also aims to bring payments for the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program in line with payments for Medicare Advantage. Trump’s plans contrast with the Medicare for All program promoted by Bernie Sanders, a Democratic socialist who is running to become the Democratic Party’s nominee against Trump in the 2020 presidential election.  Sanders’ proposal, backed by left-leaning Democrats but opposed by moderates such as former Vice President Joe Biden, would create a single-payer system, effectively eliminating private insurance by providing government coverage to everyone, using the Medicare model. “Medicare for All is Medicare for none,” said Seema Verma, the administrator of the  U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, on a conference call with reporters, calling the proposal a “pipe dream” that would lead to higher taxes. Sanders has argued that Americans would pay less for healthcare under his plan. The White House is eager to show Trump making progress on healthcare, an issue Democrats successfully used to garner support and take control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. Trump campaigned in 2016 on a promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, his predecessor President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law also known as “Obamacare.” So far he has not repealed or replaced it.  In July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said it would propose a rule for imports of cheaper drugs from Canada into the United States. A formal rule has not yet been unveiled.  The administration also issued an executive order in June demanding hospitals and insurers make prices they charge patients more transparent. Another in July encouraged novel treatments for kidney disease.   Slideshow (4 Images)Trump considered other proposals that did not reach fruition. A federal judge in July shot down an executive order that would have forced drugmakers to display list prices in advertisements, and Trump scrapped another planned order that would have banned some rebate payments drugmakers make to payers.  The administration is mulling a plan to tie some Medicare reimbursement rates for drugs to the price paid for those drugs by foreign governments, Reuters reported.

134,Britain says 88% of imports to face no tariffs in event of no-deal Brexit,"Britain on Tuesday revised the tariff regime that would come into force if it leaves the European Union without a deal, making 88% of total imports by value eligible for levy free access.  Seeking to balance the need to keep consumer prices down without destroying domestic producers, Britain also said under a new “exceptional review process” it could make changes to the regime from day one if needed. “The UK is a free trading nation and British business is in a strong position to compete in an open, free-trading environment,” Trade Policy Minister Conor Burns said. With just 23 days to go before the United Kingdom is due to leave the world’s largest trading bloc - and with no divorce deal in sight - Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is stepping up preparation for a potentially chaotic exit.  London first published a temporary tariff regime before its original leaving date in March, as part of its preparations to leave a bloc it joined in 1973.  The revised plan, which follows feedback from industry, lowers tariffs on trucks, applies tariffs to additional clothing products and adjusts levies on bioethanol to retain support for UK producers of a fuel that is important to critical national infrastructure. The government has left some protections in place for British producers, for instance carmakers and farmers, while many other industries will face cheaper competition from abroad.

136,"'Sorry, this is an emergency': Climate protesters block streets around the world","Thousands of climate-change protesters took to the streets in cities around the world on Monday, launching two weeks of peaceful civil disobedience to demand immediate action to cut carbon emissions and avert an ecological disaster. In London, police arrested 276 activists from the Extinction Rebellion group as they blocked bridges and roads in the city center, and glued themselves to cars, while protesters in Berlin halted traffic at the Victory Column roundabout. Dutch police stepped in to arrest more than 100 climate activists blocking a street in front of the country’s national museum and there were similar protests in Austria, Australia, France, Spain and New Zealand. “SORRY that we blocked the road, but this is an emergency,” declared placards held by activists in Amsterdam. In New York’s financial district, protesters spattered the Wall Street Bull and themselves with fake blood and lay prone around the sculpture to evoke their fears of a deadly environmental catastrophe.  The protests are the latest stage in an global campaign for tougher and swifter steps against climate change coordinated by Extinction Rebellion, which rose to prominence in April when it snarled traffic in central London for 11 days. Last month, millions of young people flooded onto the streets of cities around the world, inspired to take action by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Verwandte ThemenLondon police arrest 276 climate change protestersExtinction Rebellion says it expects peaceful protests over the next two weeks in more than 60 cities from New Delhi to New York calling on governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 and halt a loss of biodiversity. Banging drums and chanting, protesters in London took over Trafalgar Square and marched down the Mall, the avenue that leads to Buckingham Palace. They carried banners with slogans including “Climate change denies our children a future unless we act now”. “We’re here because the government is not doing enough on the climate emergency,” protester Lizzy Mansfield said. “We only get one planet and so we’re here to try and defend it.” Police chiefs said last week they would mobilize thousands of officers to handle the protests in London and that anyone who broke the law, even as part of non-violent civil disobedience, would be arrested. On Saturday, officers used a battering ram to enter a building in south London where activists had been storing materials to use during the protests. Eight people were arrested during the raid. “OUT OF TIME” Defying almost freezing temperatures in Berlin, activists singing “Solid as a rock, rooted as a tree” gathered at dawn at the Victory Column roundabout near Tiergarten park. At sunrise, some were sleeping in insulated bags in the middle of the roundabout as police on motorbikes drove by. No arrests were made and the protest remained peaceful.

REUTERS/Christian MangPolice blocked the five avenues that converge on the roundabout to stop cars and buses reaching the demonstration, as this would have resulted in traffic chaos during rush hour. By midday, the protest had swelled to 4,000 people, a policeman said, and a second main roundabout was also blocked by activists sitting in the middle of the road. Police began removing chanting protesters from Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz later in the day after they had occupied the central artery for much of the day, singing, making speeches and fashioning a makeshift camp out of salvaged armchairs and tents. The rallies came as German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended climate protection measures her government is due to approve on Wednesday but which critics have condemned as unambitious. In Amsterdam, police were lining up empty city buses to take the arrested demonstrators away as they tried to clear a major thoroughfare in the afternoon. “The climate crisis is not being taken seriously enough by politics, and also not by the companies. That’s why I joined,” said one demonstrator, who gave his name as Christiaan. Meanwhile activists in London, some wearing yellow safety helmets with “Rebel at Work” painted on the side, glued or chained themselves to cars parked in the middle of roads or to street lamps, making it hard for police officers to detain them. “We are out of time, there is none left, we have to act now,” said a protester called Benjamin. In central Paris, dozens of Extinction Rebellion activists blocked a street and bridge in the Chatelet district. They also built temporary shelters or held impromptu concerts and workshops in a good-natured atmosphere. Slideshow (23 Images)“This is clearly non-violent, it is human, we are not here with guns, we are here as human beings,” protester Francoise Loiseau said. With events like extreme weather, thawing permafrost and a sea-level rise unfolding much faster than expected, scientists say the urgency of the climate crisis has intensified since the signing in 2015 of the Paris accord on curbing global warming.  Nearly 70 countries announced plans at a U.N. climate action summit last month to beef up their Paris pledges, but most major economies including the United States and China failed to announce stronger new measures.

138,U.S.-China strains over Hong Kong and minority rights hinder chance of trade deal,"Prospects for progress in U.S.-China trade talks dimmed on Monday after Washington blacklisted Chinese companies over Beijing’s treatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities, and President Donald Trump said a quick trade deal was unlikely. The move by the U.S. Commerce Department could deepen divisions between Washington and Beijing at a critical juncture in their 15-month trade war that has roiled financial markets and triggered a slowdown in the global economy.  Another flashpoint has been a widening controversy over a tweet from a U.S. National Basketball Association official. His backing of Hong Kong democracy protests was rebuked by the NBA, sparking a backlash.  Trump and his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, spoke in generally upbeat terms about this week’s discussions with China, the first such high-level talks in more than two months, but Trump insisted he would not be satisfied with a partial deal. “We think there’s a chance we could do something very substantial,” Trump said, referring to minister-level talks scheduled for the end of the week. “I would much prefer a big deal and I think that’s what we’re shooting for.” Pressed to elaborate on the chances of progress this week, Trump sounded more skeptical. “Can something happen? I guess, maybe. Who knows. But I think it’s probably unlikely,” he said. The Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper, People’s Daily, on Tuesday said the talks could go three ways, namely both sides reaching a “fair” deal; the talks completely falling apart; or maintaining the state of “talking while retaliating”. “We will strive for a good outcome, but will also not force it,” the newspaper said on its official WeChat account. The post noted recent developments showed the U.S. side has yet to give up its “maximum pressure” negotiating tactics. It added China has made “sufficient and appropriate” response plans if the talks completely collapse, without elaborating. Trump also said he hoped China found a humane and peaceful resolution to the protests in Hong Kong, and warned the situation had the potential to hurt trade talks. “If anything happened bad, I think that would be a very bad thing for the negotiation. I think politically it would be very tough,” he told reporters at the White House. Police in Hong Kong have used rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against pro-democracy demonstrators in the former British colony, which has been plunged into its worst political crisis in decades.  Beijing views U.S. support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong as interfering with its sovereignty. FIRST HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS IN MONTHS U.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators on Monday launched two days of talks aimed at paving the way for the first minister-level negotiations in months. The White House officially confirmed that the high-level talks, involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, would begin on Thursday. China’s commerce ministry said Vice Premier Liu He would travel to Washington for trade talks with the United States on Thursday and Friday. In a brief statement posted on the ministry’s website, it also said Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, central bank Governor Yi Gang, and the National Development and Reform Commission’s deputy head Ning Jizhe would attend the talks. The talks are getting underway about a week before U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods are scheduled to rise to 30% from 25%. Trump has said the tariff increase will take effect on Oct. 15 if no progress is made in the negotiations. The two sides have been at loggerheads over U.S. demands that China improve protections of American intellectual property, end cyber theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms, curb industrial subsidies and increase U.S. companies’ access to largely closed Chinese markets. Trump launched a new round of tariffs after the last high-level talks in late July failed to result in agricultural purchases or yield progress on substantive issues. China quickly responded with tariff increases of its own. As Monday’s talks got underway, the U.S. Agriculture Department reported more soybean exports to China, the latest in a recent flurry of buying by Beijing. China has booked deals for about 3.5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans since early September. Despite his skepticism about a likely agreement in the short term, Trump lauded what he called Beijing’s “very, very strong” purchases of U.S. agricultural products. Kudlow told reporters the White House had formed a “study group” to examine investment issues, but said the idea of delisting Chinese firms, reported by Reuters and other media outlets last month, was “not on the table.” TRADE BLACKLIST Beijing had no immediate response on Monday to the Commerce Department’s addition of 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies to the so-called Entity List, but Chinese officials have railed at previous listings of other Chinese firms such as telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co. The department filing said the “entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.” U.S. officials said the announcement was not tied to this week’s resumption of trade talks with China. Those listed are barred from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.

139,Trump slams impeachment probe as hoax as Democrats seek White House documents,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday angrily denounced an impeachment inquiry into his July telephone call with Ukraine’s leader as Democratic lawmakers said they would subpoena White House records about the call. At a joint news conference with Finland’s president, a frustrated Trump blasted reporters who asked about the probe, which he called a hoax and a fraud, but said he would cooperate with the inquiry. “I always cooperate,” he said. His voice rising with anger, Trump lashed out at Reuters reporter Jeff Mason, who asked what he had wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to do when Trump brought up the business ties to Ukraine of Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. “It’s a whole hoax, and you know who’s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country,” he retorted. He told the reporter not to be “rude” and repeatedly evaded the question. Trump suggested, however, that his objective was corruption in Ukraine, saying the United States gives the country a lot of money, and “I don’t like giving money to a country that’s that corrupt. ... I don’t like being the sucker country.” The Democrats’ subpoena request has the potential to become a flashpoint in the showdown between the Republican president and the Democratic-led House of Representatives. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a close ally of Trump, acknowledged earlier in the day during a trip to Italy that he had listened in on the call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, a former U.S. vice president and a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the 2020 presidential election. The call prompted the House to launch its impeachment inquiry last week. Pompeo’s admission came a day after he objected to Democratic efforts as part of the impeachment inquiry to obtain depositions from five current and former State Department officials. “We’re not fooling around here, though. We don’t want this to drag on months and months and months, which appears to be the administration’s strategy,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, whose panel leads the inquiry, told a news conference alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Verwandte ThemenBiden to Trump: 'You're not going to destroy me'Temperamental Trump blows his top over impeachment inquirySee more stories House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings said he intended to subpoena the White House for the Ukraine-related records on Friday, the latest demand for evidence from an administration that has repeatedly resisted such efforts by Democrats. Trump seemed to make light of the request, telling reporters that Pelosi “hands out subpoenas like they’re cookies.” Schiff said Democrats were deeply concerned about the Trump administration’s potential interference with witnesses, and that any such efforts by the president, Pompeo or others would be considered obstruction of justice. The House launched its impeachment inquiry, which threatens Trump’s presidency, following a complaint brought by a whistleblower within the U.S. intelligence community over Trump’s request to Zelenskiy. The whistleblower provided an account of his concerns to a House Intelligence Committee aide before bringing his complaint, and some of that information was shared with Schiff, the New York Times reported, citing a spokesman for Schiff and current and former U.S. officials. Trump said the newspaper’s report showed that “Schiff is a fraud” and the president called it a “scandal” that Schiff had advance knowledge of the complaint. “He probably helped write it,” Trump said, without offering evidence. ‘HARD TO IMAGINE’ Trump made his request to Zelenskiy shortly after he had frozen nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. Zelenskiy agreed to the request on the call, and the aid was later provided. Democrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to meddle in the 2020 election for his own political benefit. “It’s hard to imagine a more corrupt course of conduct,” Schiff said. Scrutiny of Pompeo’s role in the administration’s interactions with Ukraine, including the recall of the U.S. ambassador to Kiev earlier this year, rose after the Wall Street Journal reported that the top U.S. diplomat had listened in on the Trump-Zelenskiy call.

REUTERS/Leah Millis“I was on the phone call,” Pompeo told reporters in Rome on Wednesday. Pompeo sought to portray the call as proper, saying it was in the context of U.S. policymaking in Ukraine, including “taking down the Russia threat,” rooting out corruption in government and boosting the economy. The Democratic chairmen of three House committees have accused Pompeo of intimidating witnesses and said he was considered “a fact witness” in the impeachment inquiry based on his role in Trump’s call with Zelenskiy. Pompeo said State Department employees had been contacted directly by lawmakers or their staff and told not to talk to the State Department’s legal counsel. He has said, however, that he would cooperate with Congress. Democratic-led committees previously subpoenaed Pompeo and Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, as well as documents. According to a summary of the July call released by the White House, Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani. Hunter Biden had sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been under investigation by Kiev. Trump on Wednesday called Biden and his son Hunter “stone-cold crooked.” The president has repeatedly accused the pair of wrongdoing without providing any evidence. Biden shot back in remarks prepared for a speech in Reno, Nevada, on Wednesday night, accusing Trump of “abuse of power.”  “Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me - I’m not going anywhere,” Biden said, according to excerpts provided by his campaign. The prospect that Trump solicited Ukraine’s help against his potential challenger next year has infuriated Democrats, many of whom blame the loss of the 2016 presidential election on Russian interference. Moscow has denied interfering in that campaign. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he saw no evidence of pressure in Trump’s July conversation with Zelenskiy and added that there was nothing wrong with the U.S. president asking for an investigation into potential corruption. Slideshow (5 Images)U.S. intelligence agencies and Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election with a scheme of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump’s candidacy and disparage his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Kurt Volker, who resigned last Friday as Trump’s special representative for Ukraine, is scheduled to give a deposition to House staff on Thursday. Marie Yovanovitch, who was U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until she was abruptly recalled in May, has agreed to appear on Oct. 11. In his phone call with Zelenskiy, Trump called Yovanovitch “bad news.” Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a letter to the panel’s chairman, Eliot Engel, that Schiff lacked jurisdiction to investigate the State Department’s conduct regarding Ukraine and demanded “equal representation and participation” for Republicans in questioning Volker. The impeachment probe could lead to approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove Trump from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate. Republicans, however, have shown little appetite for ousting him.

140,Temperamental Trump blows his top over impeachment inquiry,"President Donald Trump is mad as hell. Easily rankled when Democrats accuse him of wrongdoing, Trump boiled over on Wednesday at the impeachment inquiry they are pursuing over his July 25 phone call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Democrats want to prove he sought personal political gain by appealing to Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden. Trump sees the impeachment probe as a harassing follow-up to the Russia investigation that failed to knock him out of office and is frustrated that much of the U.S. news media do not cover what he views as Democratic hypocrisy. From hard-boiled tweets to lashing remarks to reporters in the Oval Office and later in the East Room, Trump’s anger built throughout the day. “The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone’s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016,” he said in a tweet. He was just clearing his throat. In the Oval Office, Trump called U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the Democrat whose House Intelligence Committee is leading the probe, “shifty Schiff.” Trump said Schiff would not be able to carry the jockstrap of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, calling it a “blank strap” out of deference to his sense of Oval Office decorum.

Democrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to meddle in the 2020 election for his own political benefit. “It’s hard to imagine a more corrupt course of conduct,” Schiff said on Wednesday. An innocent bystander to the White House events was visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, who hosted Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin for a summit in Helsinki in July 2018. A Finnish reporter looking to change the subject told Trump that “Finland is the happiest country in the world,” to which the president replied: “Finland is a happy country.” “Yeah, for sure,” Niinisto agreed amiably. After the two leaders had a lunch of Dover sole in the Cabinet Room, the stage was set for a joint news conference in the East Room.  It started out evenly. Trump expressed condolences for a stabbing attack in Finland, and Niinisto talked about European security and melting Arctic sea ice. But when the questions turned to impeachment, Trump’s stormy mood gathered force. His voice rising with anger, Trump lashed reut.rs/2oAAIP0 out at Reuters reporter Jeff Mason, who asked what he had wanted Zelenskiy to do when Trump brought up the business ties to Ukraine of Biden's son Hunter.

141,Biden to Trump: 'You're not going to destroy me',"Hours after U.S. President Donald Trump described him as “stone-cold crooked,” Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in the 2020 race for the White House, vowed on Wednesday the Republican president is “not going to destroy me.” “Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me,” Biden said in prepared remarks distributed by his campaign in advance of an appearance in Reno, Nevada, on Wednesday night. “I’m not going anywhere. You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get,” said Biden, who leads in most opinion polls among the 19 Democrats seeking their party’s nomination to face Trump in next year’s election. The back-and-forth came as Trump, first in a series of tweets and then at a news conference, angrily denounced an impeachment inquiry concerning a July call in which Trump asked Ukraine’s president to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian company while his father was vice president. Democrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to meddle in the 2020 election for his own political benefit. On Wednesday, Trump insisted that he had acted appropriately, and called Biden and his son “stone-cold crooked.” The president has repeatedly accused the pair of wrongdoing without providing any evidence. Biden, in return, accused Trump of abuse of power in a statement sent to reporters before his speech on Wednesday.

FILE PHOTO: The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File PhotoHKEX’s offer was the latest attempt at an exchange mega-merger after multiple failures between the LSE and Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) over the last 17 years. The LSE’s share price, up more than 2,000% since it listed in 2001, reflects its frequent position as a bid target. OCTOBER 2019 Hong Kong Exchange drops its plans to buy LSE, leaving the British exchange operator free to press ahead with the planned acquisition of data and analytics group Refinitiv, in which Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO) has a minority stake. SEPTEMBER 2019 HKEX makes an unsolicited $39 billion takeover bid for LSE on Sept. 11, an offer contingent on the London bourse ditching its planned acquisition of Refinitiv. LSE rejects the proposal two days later.  MARCH 2017 An attempted merger between Deutsche Boerse and the London exchange is struck down by European regulators.     MARCH 2016 U.S. company ICE (ICE.N) says here it might launch a rival bid to Deutsche Boerse's offer for LSE but shelves here that plan in May.

143,Trump economic adviser says delisting Chinese firms 'not on the table',"U.S. President Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser on Monday said the administration had begun studying U.S. investor protections in China, but that delisting Chinese companies traded on U.S. exchanges “is not on the table.” “The delisting is not on the table. I don’t know where that came from,” Larry Kudlow told reporters.     “What we’re looking at, actually, is investor protection, U.S. investor protections ... transparency and compliance with a number of laws,” he said, citing complaints from exchanges. He added that the administration had convened a “study group” to examine those issues, but said it was “very early” in its deliberations. Kudlow’s remarks come days before top U.S. officials will welcome a senior Chinese delegation for another round of trade talks. The White House confirmed on Monday the talks would begin Thursday. Shares in several U.S.-listed Chinese companies rose following Kudlow’s comments, with Hangzhou, Zhejiang-based Alibaba (BABA.N) up 1.55% and JD.com (JD.O) and Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) up 0.41% and 0.63%, respectively.  His remarks came several days after reports the administration was considering delisting Chinese companies.

145,Nobel Medicine Prize won by doctors for work on cells' response to oxygen,"Two Americans and a Briton won the 2019 Nobel Medicine Prize on Monday for discovering a molecular switch that regulates how cells adapt to fluctuating oxygen levels, opening up new approaches to treating heart failure, anaemia and cancer. William Kaelin at the U.S. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School said he was overwhelmed to get a pre-dawn call to say he and two other doctors, Gregg Semenza of Johns Hopkins University and Peter Ratcliffe of Oxford University, had won the 9-million Swedish-crown ($913,000) prize. “I don’t usually get phone calls at 5 a.m., but I knew this was ‘Nobel Monday’, so it was either going to be a poorly timed mobile call or extremely good news,” he told Reuters by telephone. “My heart started racing. It was almost surreal.” Ratcliffe, who is also clinical research director at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said in a statement he was “honoured and delighted at the news”.  The scientists’ work established the basis for understanding of how oxygen levels are sensed by cells - a discovery that is being explored by medical researchers seeking to develop treatments for various diseases that work by either activating or blocking the body’s oxygen-sensing machinery.  Their work centres on the hypoxic response - the way the body reacts to oxygen flux - and “revealed the elegant mechanisms by which our cells sense oxygen levels and respond” said Andrew Murray, an expert at Britain’s University of Cambridge who congratulated the three. Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, presents the Nobel laureates, William G. Kaelin Jr, Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza, of this year's Nobel Prize in Medicine during a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden, October 7, 2019.   Pontus Lundahl/TT News Agency/via REUTERS “VITAL INGREDIENT” “Oxygen is the vital ingredient for the survival of every cell in our bodies. Too little – or too much – can spell disaster. Understanding how evolution has equipped cells to detect and respond to fluctuating oxygen levels helps answer fundamental questions,” said Venki Ramakrishnan, president of Britain’s Royal Society scientific academy. “As (this) work.. shows us, it also gives insights into the way these processes continue to shape our health and wellbeing.” Randall Johnson, a professor at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute where the prize is awarded, said it was “a prize that really tells us the fundamental truth about how cells work”. During exercise, for example, the body uses oxygen at a rapid pace, “and this is a switch that helps the cell figure out how much oxygen it’s getting and how it should behave.” “If you have a stroke there’s suddenly no oxygen going to the brain...  Those cells, if they are going to survive, need to find a way to adapt to that level of oxygen,” he said. Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes given each year. The prizes for achievements in science, peace and literature have been awarded since 1901 and were created in the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel. Slideshow (7 Images)Nobel medicine laureates have included scientific greats such as Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, and Karl Landsteiner, who identified separate blood types and so enabled safe transfusions to be widely introduced.  Thomas Perlmann, a member of the Nobel Assembly, said he had reached Kaelin by phone early on Monday to tell him on the award. “He was really happy, almost speechless,” Perlmann said.

148,Main Canadian opposition leader slams PM Trudeau as a fraud in key election debate,"Canada’s main opposition leader repeatedly attacked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday during a pivotal televised debate, calling him a phony and a fraud who did not deserve to be re-elected on Oct. 21. Opinion polls show Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives with a real chance of defeating the ruling Liberals, whose campaign stumbled last month after images from years ago emerged showing Trudeau in blackface. Trudeau has repeatedly apologized for the images. The two-hour debate - the only one to be held in English, the language spoken by two-thirds of Canada’s 38 million population - has traditionally been regarded as an important way of winning the minds of voters. In one of the few truly memorable moments, Scheer noted the Liberal leader had not at first disclosed how many times he had put on dark makeup. Verwandte ThemenFactbox: Canada's political party positions ahead of October 21 election“He can’t even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he’s always wearing a mask,” said Scheer. “Mr. Trudeau, you are a phony and you are a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country.” The debate format - which grouped six party leaders on one stage - meant Trudeau could not respond directly to the remarks. During the evening, participants often talked over one another and were sometimes hard to understand. Trudeau came under frequent attack from his rivals and stumbled on occasion over his words. The Liberal leader, turning to face Scheer, accused him of trying to give tax breaks to Canada’s richest people. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau gesture to each other as they both respond during the Federal leaders debate in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada October 7, 2019. Justin Tang/Pool via REUTERS“You did not answer the question on why you are lowering taxes by C$50,000 for multimillionaires,” Trudeau told his rival, whom he accuses of harboring an extreme right-wing agenda.  Scheer also blasted Trudeau for a watchdog’s ruling that the prime minister and his team inappropriately tried to help a construction company in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec avoid a corruption trial. “When did you decide that the rules don’t apply to you?” he asked Trudeau. “The role of a prime minister is to stand up for Canadians’ jobs, to stand up for the public interest, and that is what I’ve done and that is what I will continue to do,” replied Trudeau. Scheer is facing questions about why he did not disclose he has dual Canadian-U.S. citizenship. One person outside the debate venue held a sign that read: “Make Andrew Canadian Again” - a play on the “Make America Great Again” slogan championed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Slideshow (28 Images)A Nanos Research poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail on Monday put the Liberals at 34.3% and the Conservatives at 33.4%, in contrast to surveys that showed Trudeau falling behind after the blackface scandal broke on Sept. 18. Trudeau has gained momentum since Scheer stumbled through a French-language debate on Wednesday. During that event, Trudeau went on the offensive against Scheer. Quebec accounts for 78 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons. The leaders will also face off in a second French-language debate on Thursday. ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters
149,Trump threatens Turkey with 'extremely decimated economy' over Syria,"President Donald Trump on Monday launched a harsh attack on NATO ally Turkey, threatening to destroy its economy if Ankara takes a planned military strike in Syria too far, even though the U.S. leader himself has opened the door for a Turkish incursion. Trump said he would “totally destroy and obliterate” Turkey’s economy if it took action in Syria that he considered “off limits” following his decision on Sunday to pull 50 American special forces troops from northeastern Syria.  The U.S. withdrawal will leave Kurdish-led forces in Syria that have long allied with Washington vulnerable to a planned incursion by the Turkish military, which brands them terrorists.  Trump’s stern words seemed to be aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds by pulling out U.S. forces. The decision drew criticism from Democrats and a rare rebuke from some of Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.      “As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I’ve done before!)” Trump tweeted.  Turkey does not appear “as of now” to have begun its expected incursion into northern Syria, a senior Trump administration official said on Monday. The Turkish Defence Ministry said on Twitter late on Monday that preparations for a possible military operation into northeastern Syria had been completed. The Trump administration official, briefing reporters on a conference call, said 50 U.S. troops in the region that Turkey has targeted would be redeployed elsewhere in Syria “where they aren’t in the crossfire.” The United States has about 1,000 troops in Syria. Verwandte ThemenU.S. Republicans join Democrats to blast Trump's Syria withdrawalExplainer: Turkey set to redraw map of Syrian war once moreSee more stories Speaking later at the White House, Trump said he had told President Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call that Turkey could suffer the “wrath of an extremely decimated economy” if it acted in Syria in a way that was not humane. Offering his rationale for the troop redeployment, Trump said his ultimate goal was to fulfill a campaign promise to bring troops home. “We’re like a police force over there. We’re not fighting. We’re policing,” he said. ‘ENDLESS WARS’ In Ankara, Erdogan told reporters he planned to visit Washington to meet with Trump in the first half of November. He said the two leaders would discuss plans for a “safe zone” in Syria, and added that he hoped to resolve a dispute over F-35 fighter jets during his visit. Turkey’s lira slid more than 2% to its lowest level in more than a month against the dollar on Monday over concerns about the planned incursion into northern Syria and Trump’s warning.  Investors have been closely watching tense ties between Ankara and Washington in recent months, with the countries at odds over a range of issues, including Syria and Turkey’s purchase of a Russian missile defence system.     Turkey has repeatedly threatened to attack U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria who have links to Kurdish guerrillas operating in Turkey. The United States began pulling troops back from the northeast Syrian border on Monday, effectively giving Turkey a green light to move into the area. Earlier on Monday, Trump said the United States should leave others from European allies to Iranian foes, “to figure the situation out” in the region.

WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.” ‘STAB IN THE BACK’ It is a major policy shift that was denounced as a “stab in the back” by Kurdish-led forces who have been Washington’s most capable partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria, also known by its acronym ISIS.         U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, called on Trump to “reverse this dangerous decision,” saying it betrayed Kurdish allies, threatened regional security and sent a message to Iran and Russia, as well as U.S. allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner. McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said in a statement: “A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.” Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who is close to Trump, called the move “a disaster in the making.” France warned that the U.S. decision to withdraw from northeastern Syria could open the door to a revival of Islamic State, which has suffered significant battlefield losses to a U.S.-led coalition in the area. The United States expects Turkey to take responsibility for captive Islamic State fighters in northeastern Syria if Ankara’s planned incursion seizes areas where the detained militants are held, a senior State Department official said. The captives are held in SDF facilities south of a safe zone initially proposed by Turkey. The official said the United States made it clear to Turkey it did not support any incursion.

150,Explainer: Turkey set to redraw map of Syrian war once more,"A looming Turkish incursion into northern Syria is set to reshape the map of the Syrian conflict once again, dealing a blow to Kurdish-led forces that have battled Islamic State while widening Turkey’s territorial control at the border. This would be Turkey’s third such incursion since 2016. Motivated largely by the aim of containing Syrian Kurdish power, Turkey already has troops on the ground across an arc of northwestern Syria, the last stronghold of anti-Damascus rebels. WHAT DOES TURKEY WANT? Turkey has two main goals in northeast Syria: to drive the Kurdish YPG militia which it deems a security threat away from its border, and to create a space inside Syria where 2 million Syria refugees currently hosted in Turkey can be settled. It had been pushing the United States to jointly establish a “safe zone” extending 20 miles (32 km) into Syrian territory, but repeatedly warned it could take unilateral military action after accusing Washington of dragging its feet. President Tayyip Erdogan has recently talked about pushing even deeper into Syria, beyond the proposed “safe zone” region to the cities of Raqqa and Deir al-Zor, in order to allow still more refugees to return to Syria. HOW WILL THE KURDS BE AFFECTED? The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have spent years expanding its control across northern and eastern Syria, helped by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. A rare case of a winner in the Syrian war, the Kurds and their allies have set up their own governing bodies while always insisting their aim is autonomy, not independence. All of this could unravel in the event of a major Turkish invasion that would plunge the area into warfare. The SDF-affiliated Syrian Democratic Council said an attack would trigger a new wave of mass displacement. For the SDF alliance, in which the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia is the dominant force, much will depend on whether the United States continues to keep forces in other parts of the northeast and east. A full U.S. withdrawal would expose the area to the risk of more Turkish advances, an Islamic State revival, or attempts by Iranian- and Russian-backed government forces to gain ground. Confronted by the prospect of U.S. withdrawal last year, the Kurds beat a path to Damascus for talks over allowing the Syrian government and its ally Russia to deploy at the border. The talks made no progress, but such negotiations could be an option again in the event of a wider U.S. withdrawal. HOW FAR COULD TURKEY GO? The northeastern border region, currently controlled by Kurdish-led forces, stretches 480 km (300 miles) from the Euphrates river in the west to the Iraq border to the east. The immediate focus of Turkey’s military plans appears to be around a section of the border between the towns of Ras al-Ain and Tel Abyad, which are about 100 km apart. A U.S. official told Reuters on Monday U.S. forces had withdrawn from observation posts there. Although under the control of Kurdish-led forces, that part of the border has historically had a strong Arab presence.  “It’s a region where the population is Arab and where Turkey has good ties with the leading groups,” said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli of the German Marshall Fund. If the YPG tries to hold territory there “it will lose a lot of blood,” he said. Turkey has not spelt out the scope or the initial focus of its planned operation. “The location, time and scope for implementing the measures against security risks will once again be decided by Turkey,” a Turkish official told Reuters. DO RUSSIA AND IRAN BACK TURKEY’S MOVE? Russia and Iran, the other two major foreign powers in Syria, strongly support President Bashar al-Assad - unlike Turkey and the United States which both called for him to stand down and supported rebels fighting to overthrow him.  Russia has said that Turkey has the right to defend itself, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Syria’s territorial integrity must be preserved and that all foreign military forces “with illegal presence” should leave Syria. If the U.S. pulls out all its troops from northeast Syria, the Damascus government - backed by Russia - may try to retake control of much of the region not seized by Turkey.  WHAT IS THE WESTERN REACTION TO TURKEY’S PLAN? There has been no public support from Turkey’s Western allies for its plan to settle 2 million Syrians - more than half of the refugees it currently hosts - in northeast Syria.  The main Western concerns are that an influx of Sunni Arab Syrians into the largely Kurdish northeast would change the demographics of the region. The United Nations regional coordinator for the Syria crisis said all sides should avoid major displacement of civilians if Turkey launches an assault.  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ASSAD? While the territory in question is already outside Syrian government control, a Turkish incursion would mean the area switching from a non-hostile force - the SDF - to Turkey and rebels that have sought to topple Assad. Damascus has long viewed Turkey as an occupying power with designs on northern Syria. It has also at times suggested a willingness to strike a deal with the Kurds, though their last negotiations got nowhere.

REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File PhotoWHAT COULD THIS MEAN FOR ISLAMIC STATE? Chaos could present Islamic State with an opportunity to stage a revival and the SDF has been conducting operations against IS sleeper cells since capturing its final territorial foothold earlier this year. Syrian Kurdish leaders have long warned that the SDF may not be able to continue holding IS prisoners if the situation was destabilized by a Turkish invasion. The SDF is still holding 5,000 IS fighters of Syrian and Iraqi nationality and a further 1,000 foreigners from more than 55 other states, according to the foreign relations department of the Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria.

Richman urged the jurors to find Tony Hernandez, who was arrested in Miami last year, guilty of drug conspiracy and possessing illegal weapons. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. Richman described Tony Hernandez as a key player in a “sophisticated state-sponsored organization” that operated with the help of “bought and paid for” Honduran government, military and police officials. “Most importantly, the defendant was protected by, and had access to, his brother, the current sitting president of Honduras,” Richman said. Believing he was immune from prosecution, Tony Hernandez became so “arrogant” that he had his initials stamped on packages of cocaine and boasted of his arsenal of illegal weapons, Richman said. Hernandez’s lawyer, Omar Malone, told the jurors the case was based on lies by drug traffickers seeking revenge on Hernandez and his brother, the president. “When he speaks of that million that he received for the campaign, the prosecutor presented no proof, no documents, no evidence,” said Amilcar Hernandez, another brother of Tony Hernandez, who attended the trial.  “What we are seeing is that the prosecution, in its desperate mood and with no conclusive evidence, is trying to drag a political character onto the humble innocent who is Juan Antonio Hernandez.” The president, who has not been charged with a crime, has in the past denied involvement in drug trafficking.  In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly last week, he said that for his “struggle against organized crime” he was the target of “a dirty smear campaign, led by narcotraffickers, gang members, corrupt or purged police, and confessed killers, businessmen who collude with those criminals and even politicians.” On Wednesday, his office said the government had broken up the six most powerful drug cartels in Honduras and extradited 24 people to the United States. A preliminary motion filed in the case August listed Juan Orlando Hernandez as a co-conspirator of his brother, both as congressman and presidential candidate before 2014, and as president. Richman told jurors they would hear from several of Hernandez’s onetime co-conspirators. One of those, according to court papers, is Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, former leader of the Cachiros drug gang, who has been cooperating with U.S. authorities since 2013. But Malone urged the jurors to be skeptical of the prosecution’s witnesses, who are currently in prison, saying they would “say what they think the government wants to hear” in an effort to get their sentences reduced. He said both Hernandez and his brother were being targeted by drug traffickers because they were tough on crime. The trial is unfolding as the Hernandez administration faces intense pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb migration to the United States from the crime-wracked and impoverished country.  Last week, Trump stood side-by-side with President Hernandez in New York, their thumbs up, as the countries struck a deal to take in more asylum seekers. The U.S. government has supported Hernandez, a conservative, as a staunch ally in the fight against drug trafficking. In Honduras he has faced mounting popular opposition and weeks of intermittent street protests since he was sworn in for a second term in January 2018 despite allegations of electoral fraud. Several other prominent Hondurans have already been prosecuted in Manhattan for drug-related crimes. Fabio Lobo, the son of a former president, was sentenced to 24 years in prison in September 2017 after pleading guilty to conspiring to import cocaine into the United States. Yani Rosenthal, a former Honduran legislator who twice ran for president, and his cousin Yankel Rosenthal, a former minister of investment, have also both been sentenced to prison. Prosecutors have said the Rosenthals worked closely with the Cachiros. ",Politik,2019-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
153,"Sensing shift, Democratic presidential candidates vow action on gun violence","Democratic presidential contenders on Wednesday vowed to pursue far-reaching limits on guns, tackling an issue that has become a top concern for their party’s voters. U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) responds to a question during a forum held by gun safety organizations the Giffords group and March For Our Lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. October 2, 2019.  REUTERS/Steve MarcusNine of the leading candidates gathered in Las Vegas for an all-day forum on gun safety, a day after the city marked two years since it suffered the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which killed 58 people. The event - co-hosted by the gun safety advocacy groups Giffords and the student-led March For Our Lives - represented an effort to keep gun violence at the forefront of the campaign, despite the looming specter of an impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump’s dealings with Ukraine. “We cannot wait for this hell to be visited upon your community for you to be activated for this fight,” said U.S. Senator Cory Booker, who spoke passionately about witnessing firsthand the scourge of gun violence in his low-income, neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey. “It is a life-and-death issue for people in communities like mine.” The candidates’ forceful words provided the latest evidence that the politics around gun control have shifted following a spate of high-profile mass shootings in recent years. Most of the Democrats were broadly in agreement on certain policies, including universal background checks, “red flag” laws that allow courts to remove guns from dangerous people and an assault-style weapons ban. But the back-to-back appearances also exposed some fissures among the Democrats over other ideas. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is leading most public polls, released a gun reform proposal hours before the event that called for banning online sales and repealing a law that gives gun makers special protections against civil liability. “Imagine if the same law existed for drug companies that existed for gun companies,” Biden said. But Biden does not support some other candidates’ proposals, such as a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons or a national licensing requirement. In his remarks, Booker - the first presidential candidate to call for licensing earlier this year - noted most people already support the concept. “You should not be a nominee from our party that can seriously stand in front of urban places and say, ‘I will protect you,’ if you don’t believe in gun licensing,” Booker said. Former U.S. Representative Beto O’Rourke, who has made gun safety the central cause of his campaign since a gunman murdered 22 people in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, two months ago, echoed his vow to force people to give up “weapons of war” through buybacks. Verwandte ThemenBiden would ban assault rifles, but not force owners to sell themSeveral candidates spoke about the particular toll gun violence has on communities of color, as well as the psychological damage done to children fearful of school shootings.  U.S. Senator Kamala Harris said teachers had told her they have lollipops on hand to keep the youngest students quiet in the event of an attack. “This is traumatizing our children,” she said.     In Washington, the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate has shown little appetite for new limits. Trump, whose 2016 campaign was bolstered by millions of dollars from the National Rifle Association, has offered mixed signals. On Wednesday, Trump blamed the Democrats’ impeachment investigation for a lack of progress on gun safety, a claim that U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren decried as an “alternative reality.” Several candidates sought to tie gun safety to the broader themes of their campaigns. Warren said gun violence has gone unchecked for the same reason that climate change and drug prices remained unaddressed in Washington: powerful companies have bought off politicians. “You have to stop and ask yourself the question: What is so badly broken in this democracy that something that the overwhelming majority of Americans want to see done doesn’t get done,” she said. “And the answer is, there’s too much power in the hands of the gun industry and the gun lobby.” Biden, who has argued that defeating Trump is the most important thing for Democrats to accomplish, said he expected new laws would pass easily once “we get this guy out of office.” Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur whose signature proposal is giving every American $1,000 a month, argued that universal basic income would help ameliorate much of the economic distress that contributes to gun violence. The forum also gave candidates an opportunity to push back against arguments that their positions are impractical or politically untenable. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said the country has already established that some limits on weapons are legal and appropriate.

154,Sanders cancels U.S. presidential campaign events after heart scare,"U.S. presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders was treated for a blocked artery after experiencing chest discomfort and has canceled campaign events until further notice, an adviser said on Wednesday. Sanders, 78, was in Las Vegas to campaign when he was taken to a hospital on Tuesday night for evaluation.  “He was found to have a blockage in one artery, and two stents were successfully inserted,” Sanders senior adviser Jeff Weaver said in a statement. “Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,” Weaver said. Sanders, the oldest of 19 contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, had visited a community healing garden in Las Vegas on Tuesday night and had been scheduled to hold a town hall and appear at a gun safety forum on Wednesday. Aides did not offer any guidance on how long Sanders might be off the campaign trail. The first nominating contest is not until Feb. 3 in Iowa, but Sanders is one of 12 candidates scheduled to participate in the fourth Democratic debate in Ohio on Oct. 15. Verwandte ThemenFactbox: Bernie Sanders heart procedure common, usually with fast recoverySanders thanked supporters for offering their well wishes and said on Twitter that he was “feeling good.” He then shifted to a plug for his signature Medicare for All healthcare insurance plan. “I’m fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover,” Sanders said. “None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!” A democratic socialist, Sanders galvanized progressives during a 2016 run for president when he lost the nomination to Hillary Clinton, pushing the party to the left and popularizing ideas such as Medicare for All, a proposal for a government-run healthcare plan based on the system for Americans over the age of 65. The U.S. senator from Vermont has been among the top contenders in the crowded field seeking the 2020 nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump. His campaign canceled at least $136,000 in cable and $600,000 in broadcast television spending following the news, according to Medium Buying, a company that tracks political ad spending. The incident could renew questions about Sanders’ age in a Democratic race featuring a generational divide between older candidates such as Sanders and front-runner Joe Biden, 76, and younger contenders such as Pete Buttigieg, 37, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

REUTERS/Brian SnyderCOMMON PROCEDURE  In a letter made public during the 2016 campaign, Sanders’ doctor said he was in “overall good health” and had no history of cardiovascular disease. The insertion of stents to open blocked heart arteries is a relatively common procedure, with as many as 1 million Americans a year undergoing it. After a balloon-tipped catheter is used to clear the blockage, stents - tiny, wire-mesh tubes - are used to prop open the artery. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush both underwent the stent procedure after they left the White House. In general, recovery takes a few days, but how quickly Sanders will bounce back depends on his symptoms before he got the stents, said Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. “People recover quickly, and assuming no complications, there is no reason why he could not get back on the campaign trail in a timely fashion,” Nissen said. Sanders had been running in second place in the Democratic race behind Biden, the former vice president, until the last month, when a surge by fellow progressive and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts moved her ahead of Sanders in many opinion polls.

155,Portals to history and conflict: the gates of Jerusalem's Old City,"Jews, Muslims and Christians pass daily through the gates of Jerusalem’s Old City, on their way to and from prayers or simply to go about their everyday business in one of the most politically sensitive spots on earth. There are eight gates - seven are open and one is sealed - along the Old City walls that were built in the 16th century by Turkish sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. It’s always busy at Damascus Gate, the main entrance to the Muslim quarter, and at Jaffa Gate, facing west toward the Mediterranean, where local residents and tourists mix in markets lining stone alleyways. Lion’s Gate - two pairs of heraldic lions are carved on the archway - is also known as St. Stephen’s Gate. It faces east, toward ancient Jericho. It is often crowded with Muslim worshippers after prayers at al-Aqsa mosque, Islam’s third holiest shrine. Many Jewish worshippers take another route to Judaism’s nearby Western Wall. They pass through the Dung Gate, the closest entrance to the holy place, and Jewish families on their way to celebrate a 13-year-old son’s Bar Mitzvah can be spotted making their way to the wall. Security is always tight in a volatile area at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli police patrol and closed circuit TV cameras monitor the passageways of the Old City. Israel views all of Jerusalem, including the walled Old City that it captured in the 1967 Middle East war, as its “eternal and indivisible” capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem, where the Old City is located, as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

156,Afghanistan braces for political uncertainty in election's wake,"Despite pulling off a safer presidential election than expected, Afghanistan looks headed for a prolonged period of political uncertainty, with the two front-runners claiming victory before ballots are tallied and signaling they would not accept defeat. The situation echoes 2014, when candidates Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah alleged massive fraud by each other, forcing the United States to broker an awkward power-sharing arrangement that made Ghani president. Both men, front-runners again, say they would not accept a similar arrangement this time. At the same time, Taliban insurgents rule more of the country than at any time since they were ousted from power nearly two decades ago, and have refused to accept the legitimacy of what they call a puppet U.S.-backed government. The unity government between the two candidates holds power until the winner is selected and takes office. Results are expected on Oct. 19. If neither man wins over half the votes, a runoff would take place.  “There is serious risk of an extended political crisis and divisive battle over the outcome, while the Taliban remain effectively unified,” said Colin Cookman, a program officer with the U.S. Institute of Peace, who has analyzed Afghan politics since 2008. Petr Stepanek, ambassador of the Czech Republic to Afghanistan, said a second round of voting possibly would not be held until spring, prolonging the uncertainty. “The election commission can say, ‘the weather is bad’ and postpone it for a couple of months,” Stepanek said. “Then we will have a weak government. A lame duck.” About 4,500 complaints have been filed since the Sept. 28 election, providing possible ammunition for the loser to reject the results. The Independent Election Commission said on Sunday that some biometric verification machines were lost. Turnout was an estimated 2.6 million votes, about one-quarter of eligible voters, following threats by the Taliban  against voting stations. Negotiations about withdrawing U.S. troops in exchange for Taliban security guarantees broke down in September, although the two sides held exploratory talks in Islamabad last week.  The next step would be negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan government about a ceasefire and the Taliban’s future role. The militant group has so far rejected any talks with the government. LITTLE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT The Ghani camp has dismissed fears of a prolonged political stalemate.  This election included more checks and balances than ever to prevent fraud, leaving Abdullah little to complain about if he loses, said Daoud Sultanzoy, a senior Ghani campaign leader.  He said he believes Ghani dominated Afghanistan’s cities and eroded Abdullah’s support in northern areas, giving him a comfortable first-ballot win. “The process is the most transparent we’ve ever used,” Sultanzoy said. “Somebody has to put (Abdullah) in his place. Enough is enough.”  Asked if Ghani would accept an Abdullah victory, Sultanzoy said that possibility was “far-fetched.” Abdullah is equally certain that his coalition of ethnic Hazaras, Tajiks, Uzbeks and some Pashtuns has made him a winner, said his spokesman, Mujib Rahman Rahimi. However the Abdullah camp is concerned about numerous irregularities, such as improbably high turnouts in insecure areas. Abdullah would accept defeat if the election is clean and only biometrically verified votes are counted, Rahimi said, adding that he has confidence in the commission. But Abdullah will not accept a tainted vote, he said. “He commands the real power in Afghanistan,” Rahimi said. “If he comes out ‘no’ (to the result) the country will collapse. We should not go that direction, that is our hope.” Diplomats, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the situation, said the more confusion that overhangs the Afghan government, the easier it will be for the Taliban to fill  the vacuum. Recent foreign visits by the Taliban may help legitimize the group, they say. Slideshow (3 Images)In Islamabad last week, Taliban members hugged Pakistan’s foreign minister and exchanged gifts before the cameras. The Taliban - which calls itself the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan - then raised issues that are the usual domain of government, such as the plight of Afghan refugees in Pakistan. The visits are “normal political activities” planned long ago, and are no attempt to fill a leadership vacuum, said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.  He added that the political uncertainty in Kabul is of no concern, since the Taliban considers the election illegitimate. ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-08 00:00:00,Reuters

Lam was speaking at a news conference after a long weekend of violent protests at which thousands of people defied colonial-era emergency powers imposed on Saturday that had banned the wearing of face masks.  Lam on Friday invoked the emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years in a dramatic move intended to quell escalating violence in the Chinese-ruled city.

158,"Hong Kong police stage show of force on streets, jeered by residents","Hong Kong police staged a show of force on Monday night in a district hit by some of the most violent clashes with protesters in recent months, but instead of being confronted by demonstrators were jeered by onlookers. Many Hong Kongers say police have used excessive force against protesters - some of them school students and young adults - and want an independent inquiry into police action. “The police are ridiculous, they are out of control,” said a  22-year-old man watching the police who gave his name only as James. “We are sticking to our beliefs and trying to express our voices to the government, but they use force to try to make us afraid and try to make us stay at home.” Police arrived in vans at several locations in the Mong Kok district and marched down the street, some beating shields, but were outnumbered by media and onlookers and withdrew to cheers. In one incident, a few dozen riot police retreated and drove off as about 150 residents and passers-by heckled them, chanting “disband police” and “Hong Kongers revolt”. Police fired tear gas and used pepper spray on people in some locations and detained a handful of people in the working class district across the harbor from the financial center that has been a focal point of past demonstrations. A handful of protesters played a cat-and-mouse game with police but there were no major confrontations by late Monday night.

Four months of protests have plunged the former British colony into its worst political crisis in decades and pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. Hundreds of protesters gathered in Hong Kong shopping malls during the day demanding “freedom”, but street protests failed to materialize in any significant size as the city struggled to recover from violent clashes in recent days. Tens of thousands of protesters, many families with children, marched peacefully through the center of Hong Kong on Sunday, most wearing face masks in defiance of the threat of a maximum one-year prison sentence for doing so. Those rallies later descended into violent clashes with police. STATIONS TORCHED The introduction of colonial-era emergency powers banning face masks, which protesters use to hide their identity, has sparked some of the most violent clashes in four months of demonstrations. “Before long, unless we are very, very lucky, people are going to get killed, people are going to be shot,” former British governor Chris Patten told Sky News.

Two protesters have been shot, one in the chest and one in the leg. Authorities said the shootings were not intentional but occurred during skirmishes between police and protesters. Many protesters, police and journalists have been injured in clashes, with police using rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against demonstrators, some of whom throw bricks and petrol bombs. On Monday, Hong Kong’s metro rail system, which typically carries about 5 million passengers a day, was only partially operating after what authorities said was “serious vandalism” on Sunday night. Some stations were torched in the protests. Many shops and Chinese banks were also extensively damaged. About one-tenth of ATMs were vandalized and cash refills may be delayed in some areas due to public events or security concerns, said the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).   The Sunday night protests, the second night of violence since the imposition of emergency laws, saw scores of protesters arrested and the first warning from Chinese military personnel stationed in the territory. INTERNET RESTRICTIONS? What started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing’s increasing grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a “one country, two systems” status promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule.

Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade with the protests damaging tourism and retail sectors.

159,"U.S.-Japan trade deal versus TPP: where it falls short, where it exceeds","U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday called his new trade deal with Japan “a game changer for our farmers and our U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a formal signing ceremony for the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement at the White House in Washington, October 7, 2019.  REUTERS/Kevin Lamarqueranchers.” But don’t expect America’s Land O’Lakes butter to knock New Zealand’s Anchor or France’s President brands off store shelves in Japan, the world’s third-largest economy. Butter is one of several U.S. dairy products that will not  get improved access to Japan’s 127 million consumers under the limited bilateral trade deal signed by Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sept. 25. The deal aims to help restore Japanese market share lost by U.S. farmers to competitors in Australia, New Zealand and Canada since Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), now an 11-country trade pact, on his third day in office in 2017. The U.S.-Japan deal’s full text was released on Monday and showed that some agricultural products would get worse access than they would have received under TPP. U.S. butter, skim milk powder and evaporated milk, along with some grains, would have competed with other TPP signatories for Japan’s new import quotas under the Pacific Rim deal. When the United States pulled out, that left more space for brands like Anchor or Australia’s Western Star. But Japan refused to grant the United States access to the TPP-wide quotas in the bilateral deal. European Union brands gained similar access in a Japan-EU trade deal launched in February.   But there are gains that bring U.S. beef, pork and wine exports in line with TPP competitors from Australia, New Zealand  and Canada, putting them on the same tariff schedule. “There are some specific parts of the ag sector that really do benefit from this,” said Matthew Goodman, an Asian economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “More broadly, this is not a highly significant deal from a commercial perspective, as it doesn’t touch the biggest item in bilateral trade, autos and auto parts.” WHAT’S LEFT OUT  The U.S.-Japan agriculture-centered deal is notable for what it leaves out. It does not include the bulk of products that make up the bilateral trading relationship, notably autos from Japan and aircraft, liquefied propane gas and semiconductor manufacturing equipment from the United States. (See graphic on top U.S. exports to Japan tmsnrt.rs/2mnCbY9) Motor vehicles and parts, by far the largest Japanese export to the United States at $56 billion in 2018, were left out for a later phase of negotiations. Abe said Trump agreed not to impose threatened “Section 232” tariffs on Japanese cars and parts on national security grounds. Japan has no tariffs on cars and trucks from the United States, but U.S. automakers argue that most American cars are kept out by environmental and safety regulations, and Japan’s currency policies that keep the yen low against the dollar. TPP would have eased Japan’s regulatory barriers, but neither agreement contained any rules to combat currency manipulation - a stated goal of the U.S. Trade Representative’s office. The United States would have eliminated its 2.5% tariff on cars made in Japan under TPP but it remains in place. Verwandte ThemenU.S.-Japan trade deal aims to put U.S. farmers on par with Trans-Pacific trade pact competitorsLESS THAN TPP America’s rice growers won’t benefit from the new bilateral trade deal, as tariffs and quotas on U.S. rice imported to Japan set in the early 1990s remain in place.  Under the TPP, Japan would have accepted 70,000 metric tons of American rice per year tariff-free under a U.S.-specific quota, but this was not included in the bilateral deal. Tim Johnson, president and CEO of the California Rice Commission, said he hoped for a better deal in later phases of U.S.-Japan talks.  Barley will see improved access to Japan, restoring U.S-specific quotas and a 45% reduction in Japan’s mark-up on imports the grain widely used in beer brewing, matching TPP competitors.  But the deal does not provide the United States access to Japan’s TPP-wide quota that grows to 65,000 tons annually over nine years. SIMILAR TO TPP  Unlike butter and skim milk powder, cheese — the largest U.S. dairy export to Japan — will see elimination of Japan’s tariffs of up to 40% over 15 years, as it would have done under TPP. U.S. beef and pork are the major winners in the U.S.-Japan deal. Beef will see Japanese tariffs falling from 38.5 percent currently to 9% by 2033, on the same schedule as TPP competitors Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Pork will see Japanese tariffs eliminated on muscle cuts over 9 years and the 20% tariff on ground seasoned pork eliminated in the deal’s fifth year. Japan will eliminate its 10 percent duty on imports of certain U.S. ethanol in 10 years, affecting about $11 million worth of imports, according to a USTR fact sheet. The deal maintains Japan’s zero duty on U.S. corn for animal feed but grants a quota eliminating a 3% duty on sweet corn and other types of corn, the USTR said. Wheat will see a U.S.-specific quota in Japan that will grow to 150,000 metric tonnes over six years, and a 45% reduction in Japan’s markup for wheat imports, matching TPP competitors. Japan’s tariffs on U.S. wine will also will fall, from 15% to 7.1% on April 1, 2020, basically the same level they would have under the TPP, the Wine Institute said. But Japanese documents say that no concessions were granted for other types of alcohol. U.S. bourbon and Tennessee whiskey had won some labeling protections in TPP along with tariff reductions. BETTER THAN TPP  The main improvement over TPP comes from the U.S.-Japan digital trade agreement, say congressional aides and tech industry officials. They described it as “TPP-Plus” and in line with U.S. goals to set global internet and e-commerce rules.    Slideshow (4 Images)It includes stronger rules to prohibit cross-border taxation of digital downloads and data localization requirements than TPP. Cloud computing and new financial technologies were still new and being developed during the many years TPP was negotiated, so that deal included carve outs that would have allowed some countries to require local housing of financial sector data. USTR said the deal protects against the forced disclosure of proprietary computer source code and algorithms, demands that it says China frequently makes of U.S. firms. It also said the deal promotes open access to government-generated data. Overall, the digital deal is in line with the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement, regarded as an upgrade from TPP on digital economy issues. Japanese Prime Minister Abe said it reflects Japan’s status as an ally of the United States in trying to set high-standard, open internet rules for the world.

Following the meetings with top Justice Department officials, the state attorneys general met with department staffers, one source said. Facebook, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has 2.4 billion monthly users, agreed in July to pay a $5 billion FTC settlement for various privacy violations. Reuters and others reported in June that the Justice Department and FTC had divided responsibility for the companies being investigated, with the Justice Department taking Alphabet Inc’s Google and Apple Inc while the FTC looked at Facebook and Amazon.com Inc. The Justice Department later said it was opening a probe of online platforms, which would include Facebook. The Washington Post was first to report that the group was likely to expand sharply.

161,U.S. women's team fights back against governing body's pay claims,"U.S. women’s national soccer team players pushed back in a court filing on Monday against claims by the U.S. Soccer Federation that some members earn more than their male counterparts, as they argued for class action status in the latest chapter of their closely-watched legal fight. Soccer Football - Women's World Cup Final - United States v Netherlands - Groupama Stadium, Lyon, France - July 7, 2019  Carli Lloyd of the U.S. and team mates celebrate winning the women's world cup with the trophy     REUTERS/Bernadett SzaboAll 28 member of the U.S. women’s national soccer team sued the U.S. Soccer Federation for gender discrimination in March in a lawsuit that included complaints about wages and working conditions. Mediation between the two parties broke down in August, weeks after U.S. Soccer’s President Carlos Cordeiro said in an open letter that the organization has paid more to the women’s team than the men’s in recent years. A week ago, the organization said it opposed the women’s players bid for class action status in their suit.  “Over the class period, the (Women’s National Team) has played far more games than the (Men’s National Team) and amassed a far higher win percentage, including earning two World Cup championships,” the suit’s plaintiffs said in Monday’s court filing. “This is the only reason why the four (Women’s National Team) class representatives were able to earn more total compensation than members of the (Men’s National Team).” Those four players - Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Alex Morgan and Becky Sauerbrunn - would have earned far more under the men’s team’s pay rate policy, the plaintiffs argued in the filing. A spokesman for U.S. Soccer said members of the men’s national team have the chance to earn larger bonuses, but they do not receive guaranteed money in their “pay-for-play contract structure.” “Our men and women’s national teams have different pay structures, not because of gender, but because each team chose to negotiate a different compensation package with U.S. Soccer,” the spokesman said.  The U.S. women’s team successfully defended its World Cup title in July in France, defeating the Netherlands in the final. The team has four women’s World Cup titles, more than any other nation. Players from the U.S. men’s squad threw their support behind their female counterparts in July and accused U.S. Soccer of not paying a fair share of generated revenue to national team players. The dispute has attracted international attention, with numerous celebrities, athletes and politicians backing the women’s players amid renewed conversation over pay equity in the United States.

162,The transported: Kashmiri prisoners sent far from home,"One is a 19-year-old construction worker charged with aiding militants against Indian troops, the other is one of Kashmir’s most prominent lawyers, accused of being “an incorrigible secessionist”. Despite their different backgrounds, Uzair Maqbool Malik and Nazir Ahmad Ronga have something in common: they are among hundreds of people who have been detained without trial by Indian authorities following a crackdown in the disputed region of Kashmir and moved to jails far from home.  India’s portion of the Kashmir Valley – a Muslim-majority territory also claimed by Pakistan – has been under lockdown since the region’s statehood and autonomy were revoked on Aug. 5. Authorities have cut off mobile communications in the valley and detained nearly 4,000 people, many of whom have since been released, according to the government.  At least 300 people have been arrested under the Public Safety Act (PSA), which allows for detentions of up to two years without trial, the government said. Most have been sent to jails across the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.  Many are young men like Malik, a high-school dropout who works in construction. But there are others like Ronga, a former head of the bar association in Kashmir, and dozens of other lawyers, academics and leaders of political parties.  Indian officials say the policy of transporting detainees, which started last year but has snowballed since August, is required to cut off militants from their networks. The transportations are often conducted without warning, and families say they are allowed little contact with detainees once they find them. Proving innocence is difficult even for those with resources given the communications situation in Kashmir and the number of cases. Sanjay Dhar, the registrar general of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, said two judges in Kashmir’s main city of Srinagar were handling around 300 appeals against PSA detentions filed since Aug. 5. ACCUSED OF AIDING MILITANTS Malik, 19, grew up in Shopian, a town of around 16,000. As a child, he was friends with two boys who joined a militant group fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, a rebellion that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.  That childhood association forms the basis of the case against him, according to court documents. In the documents, Malik is accused of assisting the two militants “in letter and spirit” and giving them “logistic support”. They also say he participated in protests and an operation against security forces, between February 2018 and July 2019. “You not only yourself indulge in stone pelting but instigate others,” one document said. Malik’s family denies the charges and say he has not seen the boys who joined the militants since they left. They said he participated in protests in 2016 and was hit in the eye by a metal pellet fired by security forces, partially blinding him. Malik dropped out of school and his family had to sell land to pay for surgery. “He hasn’t done anything since,” his mother, Haseena Malik, said. “He has made no mistake.” Dilbag Singh, chief of police for Jammu and Kashmir, said people detained under the PSA had been involved in subversive and terrorist activities, or disturbing public order. “All required procedural requirements under law are followed while executing detentions under PSA,” he said. Singh said some individuals had been moved due to lack of space in Kashmir’s jails. He said authorities were “checking the specific details” regarding the detentions of Malik and Ronga but had no additional information on their cases. FARAWAY JAIL For almost two weeks after he was arrested, Malik’s family visited him twice a day, and officers repeatedly told them he would be released soon. But he was abruptly moved to the central jail in Srinagar, 50 kilometers away. When his family went to check on him, they were told he had been moved to a jail in Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, with 84 other Kashmiris. The jail is one of at least six facilities in Uttar Pradesh where Kashmiris have been moved, officials said. Reuters followed several families, including the Maliks, as they traveled to Agra last month to visit detained relatives. Around a dozen relatives and friends of four men held in Agra said they were not informed about the transfers, and that prohibitive travel costs and limited visiting hours meant they had little contact with those detained. On Sept. 17, Malik’s father, Mohammed, and his brother Danish managed to meet him after waiting for several hours.  “He isn’t scared,” Danish said, adding that he was being treated well. “He was telling us not to worry, to take care of the family.”  LEGAL WRANGLE  Even influential Kashmiris like Ronga, a 67-year-old criminal lawyer who once headed the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association, have been targeted in the crackdown. He was detained in Srinagar on Aug. 9. Ronga  was detained to help prevent “violence, strikes, economic adversity and social indiscipline” according to court documents laying out his detention order.  He was briefly detained at a local police station, before being transferred to Srinagar’s central jail. It took his son Umair Ronga, who is also a lawyer, a week to find him.      In the court documents, dated Aug. 17, Ronga is described by magistrates as “an incorrigible secessionist”. His son denies the charges. His father once represented Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, a prominent separatist, but has no political links with his organization, the Hurriyat Conference, he said. But he was involved in pursuing cases related to the region’s status in India’s Supreme Court, Umair Ronga said.  Slideshow (6 Images)“We were vocal in the Supreme Court of India, not on the roads,” he said. “That is not a crime.” On Sept. 3, Umair returned to the Srinagar jail and found his father had been moved to a jail in Uttar Pradesh.  “He has always advocated the rule of law and the supremacy of the judiciary,” he said. “Now, the same system is being used against him.” ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters
163,U.S.-Japan trade deal aims to put U.S. farmers on par with Trans-Pacific trade pact competitors,"The new U.S.-Japan trade deal will provide staged reduction of Japanese tariffs for more than $2 billion worth of U.S. beef and pork, matching access now granted to the 11 Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact countries, a text of the agreement shows. U.S. President Donald Trump presided over a White House signing ceremony on Monday for the final text of the limited bilateral trade pact, more then 2-1/2 years after he pulled the United States out of the much broader TPP.  The move left U.S. farmers and food producers at a disadvantage in the Japanese market to competitors from Australia, New Zealand and Canada, and the U.S.-Japan deal aims to even that playing field by cutting Japanese tariffs on many of those products. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office said the pact would immediately eliminate Japan’s tariffs on U.S. food and agricultural imports valued at about $1.3 billion per year, including almonds, blueberries, cranberries, walnuts, sweet corn, lactose, milk albumin, grain sorghum, food supplements, broccoli and prunes. It said an additional $3 billion worth of products would benefit from staged tariff elimination, matching access conditions in the TPP. That group includes processed pork, beef offal, frozen poultry, wine, frozen potatoes, oranges, fresh cherries, cheese and whey, ethanol, egg products and tomato paste. The deal will restore a country-specific tariff free quota for U.S. wheat that will grow to 150,000 metric tons over six years, matching TPP, and Japan will reduce its markup on imported U.S. wheat by 45% to the same levels as TPP countries. Barley will see access to Japan partially restored to TPP levels with a 45% reduction in markup over eight years, and Japan will establish new country-specific quotas for U.S. unroasted malt. But the deal does not provide the United States access to a TPP-wide quota that grows to 65,000 tons over nine years. ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters

165,U.S. Attorney General Barr met Italian intelligence officials: newspaper,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr held two secret meetings with Italian intelligence agencies as part of an investigation by President Donald Trump’s administration into the origins of the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 American election, Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper reported on Wednesday. U.S. Attorney General William Barr participates in a presentation ceremony of the Medal of Valor and heroic commendations to civilians and police officers who responded to mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S. September 9, 2019. REUTERS/Erin ScottWithout citing its sources, the newspaper said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had authorized the two meetings in Rome with Gennaro Vecchione, head of the DIS intelligence service, as well as other officials in August and last week. “I respect and take notice of what is reported in the media but if I have to make things clear I will do it exclusively in the appropriate forums. On the rest, no comment”, Vecchione said in a statement. There was no comment from Conte’s office in Rome. A political source told Reuters on Wednesday that Conte could be asked in coming weeks to respond before the parliamentary committee for security about the reported meetings. U.S. intelligence agencies and Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election with a scheme of hacking and propaganda to boost Republican Trump’s candidacy and disparage his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Mueller detailed a series of contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russia. Trump, who is running for re-election next year, has called the Russia investigation a “witch hunt” and has repeatedly sought to discredit it. Barr, a Trump appointee who is the top U.S. law enforcement official, is personally involved here in investigating Trump's complaints that he and his 2016 campaign were improperly targeted by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Barr in May appointed federal prosecutor John Durham to look into the matter. U.S. Democrats have called the investigation an effort to sully the conclusions of Mueller and U.S. intelligence agencies to benefit Trump politically, even as the House of Representatives pursues an impeachment inquiry arising from Trump’s request that Ukraine investigate domestic political rival Joe Biden. U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said on Monday that Trump had contacted other countries to introduce Barr and Durham. Kupec did not name the countries in her statement, but U.S. media have said Barr made overtures to British intelligence and had visited Italy. Corriere della Sera said Barr’s meetings focused on the origins of the U.S. Russia investigation and on the actions of Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese university professor, a key figure in the events that triggered the Russia probe. Mifsud was teaching at a Rome university when the scandal erupted. His present whereabouts are unknown. Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, when he pleaded guilty last year to U.S. criminal charges arising from the Mueller investigation, acknowledged that Mifsud had told him in April 2016 that Russia had “dirt” on Clinton, three months before hacked emails started appearing online and harming the Clinton campaign. Papadopoulos told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Clinton. Australian officials passed that information to their U.S. counterparts two months later, helping trigger an FBI probe into Russian attempts to influence the Trump campaign. The Corriere della Sera said Barr requested that the Italian agencies provide any documentation they had gathered. ",Politik,2019-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
166,Giuliani's unusual role key to exposing internal Trump documents,"Rudy Giuliani’s wide-ranging work for U.S. President Donald Trump could make it tougher for him to claim Ukraine-related documents demanded by Congress as part of its impeachment inquiry are confidential and protected under lawyer-client privilege, experts said. The Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to Giuliani on Monday, setting an Oct. 15 deadline for him to turn over documents related to his efforts to work with Ukrainians to investigate Trump’s potential 2020 Democratic election rival Joe Biden.  The former New York mayor said on Monday the subpoena raised issues of “attorney client and other privileges.” [nL2N26L1BI] The Committee warned that failure to comply could amount to obstruction or be used as an adverse inference against Trump and Giuliani.  Jon Sale, who is representing Giuliani, said he would be preparing a response to the subpoena and that it would be up to Trump and his office whether to assert such privileges. Giuliani has emerged as a central figure in a scandal that has now engulfed Trump and left him facing an impeachment inquiry into whether he misused his office for his own political gains.  Giuliani told Reuters he met Ukrainian officials in Madrid, Paris and Warsaw this year as he pushed the Biden investigation.[nL2N26L02D] His unconventional role will be central to any fight over his communications. Giuliani is not employed by the U.S. government, undermining the concept of executive privilege, which is intended to protect communications between the president and close advisers to ensure candid, private advice.  “There is no significant precedent or support generally for the idea that a person outside the government is protected by executive privilege in the way that White House staff would be,” Mark Rozell, the dean of George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government. Attorney-client privilege protects lawyers from testifying against clients, but is generally limited to confidential communications about legal advice, experts said. Giuliani told Reuters that he did not view his work as a “political act,” an important distinction if a fight erupts over access to documents. Political missions on a client’s behalf are fair game for disclosure, legal experts said They said they knew of no court that had directly addressed attorney-client privilege in the context of an investigation involving a sitting president’s communications with a personal attorney. During the Clinton administration, an appeals court ruled that the White House could not claim attorney-client privilege to avoid handing over documents to a grand jury.   But that case involved communications with White House counsel, or government lawyers, not a personal lawyer like Giuliani.  Even if Giuliani can make the case that his work for Trump amounted to legal advice normally protected from disclosure, not all his communications would be privileged. Documents such as calendars, phone logs and communications with third parties will be difficult to protect from Congress, legal experts said.   Democrats could also argue that Giuliani cannot shield communications that were made in furtherance of a fraud or criminal conduct. Courts have long recognized that the attorney-client privilege does not apply to such communications. Giuliani says that what he did was above board and that his efforts were aimed at rooting out corruption in Ukraine. Department of Justice officials concluded in September that Trump’s conduct on a call with Ukraine’s president that triggered the impeachment inquiry did not violate campaign finance law. [nL3N26G2QH] Any fight over privilege could wind up in federal court, where a judge would need to determine whether disputed documents amounted to legal advice. The process could take weeks or months as any decision could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, according to legal experts. Giuliani’s other role, as defender of the president in the media, could also work against him, according to Michael Stern, who served as senior counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives from 1996 to 2004. Democrats could claim he “waived” privilege by discussing his communications in a recent flurry of interviews including TV appearances on CNN and Fox News. “When you go on TV all the time it is kind of hard to claim attorney-client privilege on things you’ve talked about,” Stern said.

167,"Trump impeachment probe gains steam with briefing, depositions","Two former officials who were engaged in the Trump administration’s dealings with Ukraine will meet with U.S. congressional committees starting this week, as the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump gains steam. Congressional staff was also due to attend a briefing at the Capitol on Wednesday by the State Department’s inspector general, Steve Linick, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Staff members from the Senate and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations, Intelligence, Oversight and Appropriations committees were invited to the briefing. The session was expected to address Ukraine-related documents that have been subpoenaed by House committees. Following a whistleblower complaint last week, Democrats are looking into Trump’s request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a July 25 phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender in the Democratic race to run against Republican Trump in the 2020 election. The unidentified whistleblower is said to be an intelligence agent who accused Trump of soliciting foreign interference for his personal political benefit. Trump has denied wrongdoing and assailed the probe. Kurt Volker, who resigned last week as Trump’s special representative for Ukraine, was to go to Capitol Hill to give a deposition to House staff on Thursday, the day he had been asked to appear. Marie Yovanovitch, who was U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until she was abruptly recalled in May, has agreed to appear on Oct. 11, not on Wednesday as originally requested. Verwandte ThemenAustralia PM says Trump call on Mueller probe was 'uneventful'Back home, at-risk Democrats face voters' partisan divide on impeachmentWith their deep knowledge of Ukraine, testimony by Yovanovitch and Volker could be especially important to the impeachment probe formally launched by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week. The inquiry could lead to approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. That would lead to a trial in the Senate on whether to remove him from office. But the president’s fellow Republicans control that chamber and have shown little appetite for removing him. Yovanovitch was ordered back to Washington two months before the end of her three-year tour in Kiev. The career diplomat, who had served during both Republican and Democratic administrations, had been the subject of attacks in right-leaning media and Democrats had suggested her recall was politically motivated. MORE SUBPOENAS EXPECTED Over the past few days, the Democratic chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees have issued subpoenas to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and scheduled depositions with a series of other current and former officials, as well as associates of Giuliani, as they seek to unearth more evidence of potential wrongdoing by Trump. Trump asked Zelenskiy during the July call to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani. Announcements of more subpoenas and requests for depositions are expected.  The impeachment investigation has cast a pall over Trump’s re-election effort.

168,U.S. Supreme Court snubs University of Wisconsin appeal in patent fight with Apple,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear a bid by the University of Wisconsin’s patent licensing arm to reinstate its legal victory against Apple Inc in a fight over computer processor technology that the school claimed the company used without permission in certain iPhones and iPads. The justices, on the first day of their new term, declined to review a lower court’s 2018 decision to throw out the $506 million in damages that Apple was ordered to pay after a jury in 2015 decided the company infringed the university’s patent. The licensing body, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), filed suit in 2014, alleging infringement of a 1998 patent on a “predictor circuit” to help speed the way processors carry out computer program instructions. The patent was developed by computer science professor Gurindar Sohi and three of his students at the university, located in Madison, Wisconsin. WARF, which helps patent and commercialize the university’s inventions, claimed that Apple incorporated the technology in its A7, A8 and A8X processors, found in the iPhone 5s, 6 and 6 Plus, as well as several versions of the iPad tablet.  Apple disputed the claims, saying its processor worked differently based on the specific language spelled out in WARF’s patent. A federal jury in Madison in 2015 ordered Apple to pay $234 million in damages. A judge later added supplementary damages and royalties based on Apple’s continued infringement through the December 2016 expiration of WARF’s patent, and issued a $506.1 million judgment against Apple in 2017. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized patent court located in Washington, last year overturned the jury verdict, saying that based on the “plain and ordinary” meaning of the patent, Apple could not have infringed it. WARF appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Federal Circuit incorrectly ignored the jury’s understanding of the patent and its role in determining the facts of the case. At the very least, WARF asked the justices to send the case back to the lower court so that it can present more evidence. ",Top-Nachrichten,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters

170,Restoring felon voting rights a 'mess' in battleground Florida,"Clifford Tyson wants to help choose America’s next president. But the Florida resident fears his vote might return him to jail. Tyson, 63, owes court-ordered fines and fees for three felony convictions, one for robbery, two for theft, all decades old. Under a Florida law that went into effect July 1, he must pay those penalties before casting a ballot or risk being prosecuted for voter fraud. Tyson searched court records, first on his own, then with the help of a nonprofit legal advocacy group. They say that because Florida has no comprehensive system for tracking such fines, the documents don’t make clear what he owes. The records, viewed by Reuters, show potential sums ranging from $846 to a couple thousand dollars related to crimes he committed in the late 1970s and 1990s. Tyson says he won’t risk voting until Florida authorities can tell him for sure. “Until there is clarity, as much as I want to vote, I won’t do it,” Tyson said. The Tampa pastor is now a plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the payments law, which was crafted by Florida’s Republican-controlled legislature and signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, also a Republican. The law came just months after Floridians approved a ballot initiative restoring voting rights to more than 1 million felons who have completed their sentences; that change to the state’s Constitution created a potentially huge new crop of voters in a critical battleground state ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The lawsuit, filed in June by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Brennan Center for Justice, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense and Educational Fund, alleges the fees requirement defies the will of Florida voters and amounts to an illegal poll tax on newly enfranchised Florida felons, many of them minorities. But another argument is shaping up to be central to the plaintiffs’ case: Florida has no consolidated system for determining what felons owe or certifying that they have paid up. It’s a situation that ex-offenders say makes it virtually impossible for them to prove they are eligible to vote. Those claims are bolstered by state election officials who say they can’t calculate what felons owe, either, according to a Reuters review of 7 depositions, emails and other internal correspondence from voting administrators submitted by plaintiffs’ attorneys as part of the lawsuit. Florida has no centralized database where records of court-ordered fines and fees - and any payments of those penalties - are stored, election and court officials say. To get that information, felons typically must search documents in courts where they were convicted, be they federal or state, inside or outside Florida. Records have been found to be incomplete, contradictory or missing, plaintiffs’ attorneys say. With the Feb. 18 deadline to register for the state’s 2020 presidential primary approaching, the issue is taking on urgency. An estimated 436,000 felons have fees to settle before they can vote, according to a study by University of Florida political scientist Daniel Smith, an expert witness for the ACLU. The study was based on court data and Department of Corrections records. The stakes are high. Florida commands 29 of the 538 electoral votes that are used under the U.S. Electoral College system to select the American president. In Florida and most other states, the candidate who places first in the popular vote – even if just by a hair – wins all the electoral votes. Florida has a history of tight elections and contested outcomes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys say Florida has shifted all responsibility for compliance with the new payments law to ex-offenders, who risk prosecution if they get it wrong. The state contends the legislature merely implemented the constitutional amendment as it was written on the ballot. The legislation, known as SB 7066, “sows seeds of confusion,” said Leah Aden, deputy director of litigation at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “It will chill participation.” Some of the state’s 67 county elections supervisors - the public servants who ultimately decide which felons get culled from the rolls and which can stay - expressed concern in their depositions and to Reuters about making mistakes that could invite challenges to future election results. Five testified recently in the lawsuit that they lack the manpower to do detailed searches or have no way of ascertaining for certain whether ex-offenders have met their financial obligations under SB 7066. They said they are relying on Florida’s Department of State, which manages the state’s elections, to help them determine who is ineligible. That agency is developing a procedure to send counties regularly updated lists of felons on their rolls who have unpaid fines and fees, but it has no timetable as to when it will be ready, said Maria Matthews, the director of the Department of State’s Division of Elections, in a September deposition. Matthews did not respond to multiple requests for comment. For now, the agency is providing counties only with names of Florida felons who are incarcerated, and thus ineligible to vote, Toshia Brown, chief of the department’s Voter Registration Services, said in an August deposition. Brown did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Pastor Clifford Tyson, a former felon working to restore his voting rights, meets with the relatives of felons and ex-felons before a radio interview in Tampa, Florida, U.S., September 10, 2019.  Picture taken September 10, 2019.   REUTERS/Brian SnyderAn early list sent to Leon County in Florida’s Panhandle region appeared to contain inaccuracies, Deputy Elections Supervisor Christopher Moore said in a July email to his staff, which was viewed by Reuters. Moore’s office researched a June list provided by the Department of State containing 66 names of allegedly incarcerated felons, but could not determine whether felony convictions existed for 24 of them – 36% of the total - emails exchanged between Moore and his staff show. “This process is not off to a very accurate start and we are playing with people’s eligibility to vote,” Moore said in the July email. Moore told Reuters that subsequent data his office has received from the Department of State has gotten better. Sarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the Department of State reviews information from a variety of sources, makes an initial determination on a voter’s eligibility, then passes that along to county supervisors. She said the agency is working to “improve the accuracy and efficiency of the information,” but said it’s up to those elections supervisors to make the final call. Some backers of the payments law say the responsibility should be on ex-offenders, not the state, to figure out how to comply with SB 7066. “If you’re going to register to vote and you’re a former felon, it’s worth double checking to make sure you took care of everything,” said J.C. Martin, chairman of the Polk County Republican Party in central Florida. A federal judge in the Northern District of Florida has set a Monday hearing on the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction to throw out the fees requirement. A decision could come as early as this month. NO CENTRALIZED DATABASE Florida stripped felons of their votes during the Jim Crow era in 1868, a ban that endured 150 years and disproportionately affected black voters. As recently as 2016, more than 1.4 million people with felony convictions were barred from voting in Florida, including one in five African American adults, according to The Sentencing Project, a criminal justice nonprofit, which used state conviction and incarceration records for the study. In November 2018, nearly 65% of Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment restoring voting rights to felons, except those convicted of murder and sex crimes. Through the end of July, Florida recorded around 337,000 new voter registrations, 45,000 of them by African Americans. That’s a 22% increase in new black voters compared to the same period in 2015, the year preceding the last presidential election, a Reuters analysis of Florida voting data shows. The ballot initiative said felons must first complete “all terms of their sentence including parole or probation.” Republican lawmakers interpreted that to include any court costs, fines, fees and restitution to victims imposed at sentencing. In May, they passed a bill requiring repayment as a condition for voting. DeSantis, the governor, signed it into law in June amid criticism by voting rights advocates that the legislation was intended to suppress potential votes of African Americans, who tend to vote Democratic. DeSantis has dismissed claims that the law is a poll tax. The state is still discussing ways to centralize data to track payments. Building a consolidated system could take years and cost millions, according to lawmakers and officials who debated the issue before the law’s passage. “Right now, the system is just a mess,” ACLU attorney Julie Ebenstein said. Sean Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center said the group spent weeks trying to track down what Tyson owes, but couldn’t get a clear answer. For example, Tyson has a 1998 theft conviction in Hillsborough County on Florida’s Gulf Coast. A judgment order on the clerk’s online docket shows he was ordered to pay $661 in costs, fines and fees. But a separate subpage on the website indicates he was ordered to pay $1,066. Still another shows a total of $573. Tyson’s lawyers say no officials have been able to explain the discrepancies. State Representative Jamie Grant of Tampa, a Republican supporter of SB 7066, said critics of the law are the ones trying to defy the will of the electorate.

171,"GE to freeze, pre-pay pensions to save up to $8 billion, cut debt","General Electric Co said on Monday it would freeze pensions for about 20,000 salaried U.S. employees and take other related moves to help the ailing conglomerate cut debt and reduce its retirement fund deficit by up to $8 billion. Analysts said the move would largely offset the rise in GE’s pension obligations due to lower interest rates and was in line with other steps Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp has taken over the past year to raise cash and pare down $105.8 billion in debt.  Culp has slashed GE’s quarterly dividend to a penny and has sold - or announced plans to sell - non-core businesses, slimming the once-sprawling company to focus just on power plants, jet engines and windmills, plus related equipment and services. GE’s pension plans are among its biggest liabilities and were underfunded by about $27 billion at the end of 2018. U.S. employees facing the pension freeze will be moved to a defined-contribution retirement plan, such as a 401(k) plan, in 2021. The company has struggled to boost profits amid a slump in demand for its gas-fired turbines for power generation. It also faces potential costs of more than $1 billion in its jet engine unit from the grounding of Boeing Co’s 737 MAX airliner.  GE also is likely to set aside about $11 billion to cover liabilities for its long-term care insurance business. By freezing the U.S. pensions, pre-paying about $4.5 billion in contributions due in 2021 and 2022 and offering lump sums to about 100,000 retirees, GE said it expects to cut pension underfunding by $5 billion to $8 billion. William Blair & Co. analyst Nicholas Heymann said there was no immediate net reduction in GE’s pension liabilities given the 90 basis-point decline in long-term interest rates since the end of last year, which has caused its pension liabilities to creep up to about $34 billion from $27 billion toward the end of 2018.  “The impact is being offset now, rather being reduced. So it is possible that investors are not cheering,” Heymann told Reuters. He added, though, that Culp “is setting up (GE for) much better performance next year.”  GE’s shares were down 0.2% at $8.55 in afternoon trading, after rising 2.6% to $8.79 in premarket trading.      The pension freeze takes effect Jan. 1, 2021. The moves also are expected to help lower GE’s net debt by $4 billion to $6 billion, the Boston-based company said, adding that there would be no change for retirees already collecting pension benefits.  GE’s industrial net debt stood at $54.4 billion as of June 30. “Returning GE to a position of strength has required us to make several difficult decisions, and today’s decision to freeze the pension is no exception,” GE Chief Human Resources Officer Kevin Cox said in a press release. GE’s pension plan has been closed to new entrants since 2012. The company had about 283,000 employees at the end of 2018, about 97,000 of them in the United States. GE expects to record a non-cash pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter, but did not specify the amount. The company also said it would pre-fund about $4 billion to $5 billion of its requirements for 2021 and 2022 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by using a portion of the $38 billion in cash it is collecting from the sale of various businesses. GE said it was on track to hit its target of less than 2.5 times net-debt-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, by the end of 2020.

172,Judge's order releasing Trump's tax returns and blasting 'repugnant' immunity claim put on hold,"A federal judge on Monday said eight years of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax returns must be provided to Manhattan prosecutors, forcefully rejecting the president’s argument that he was immune from criminal investigations. Trump’s returns will not be turned over immediately, after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan granted the president’s request to temporarily block the order, handed down by U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero. The Manhattan judge had called the immunity claim “repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values,” and said he could not “square a vision of presidential immunity that would place the President above the law.” His 75-page decision complicates Trump’s battle to keep his finances under wraps, despite having promised during his 2016 White House run that he would disclose his tax returns. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, had subpoenaed personal and corporate tax returns from 2011 to 2018 and other records from Trump’s longtime accounting firm Mazars USA. The subpoena was part of Vance’s criminal probe into the Republican president and his family business. Marrero’s decision would have forced Mazars to start turning over documents on Monday afternoon, but the appeals court said the case had “unique issues,” justifying a delay. The court said it may hear Trump’s appeal as soon as the week of Oct. 21 to 25. Trump has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing. Two committees of the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives have separately subpoenaed Deutsche Bank AG for Trump’s financial records, which include tax returns. “The Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump,” Trump tweeted after Marrero’s decision. “A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!” In suing Vance last month to block his subpoena, Trump said he was immune from criminal probes while in the White House and that the U.S. Constitution required Vance to wait. HOUSE PROBE The Constitution does not say whether sitting presidents can be indicted, and the Supreme Court has not decided the issue. Federal prosecutors cannot charge sitting presidents because presidents have temporary immunity, according to the Department of Justice, but that does not block criminal probes by state-level prosecutors like Vance or even federal prosecutors. “It’s uncharted legal terrain,” Jens David Ohlin, vice dean at Cornell Law School, said in an interview.”If the framers of the Constitution desired a president who was completely immune from all forms of criminal prosecution, they would have said so,” he added. “The counterargument is that the Constitution would prohibit it because it would infringe on the president’s ability to govern the country.” FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump attends Young Black Leadership Summit at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 4, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File PhotoVance issued the subpoena four weeks after issuing another subpoena to the Trump Organization for records of hush money payments, including to two women prior to the 2016 election who said they had sexual relationships with Trump, which he denies. Those payments were made to Stormy Daniels, a porn star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, with the involvement of Trump’s now-imprisoned former lawyer Michael Cohen. Trump is also trying to block the House subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and is awaiting a ruling from the 2nd Circuit. The House probes are separate from the debate over whether Trump should be impeached because of his dealings with Ukraine. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump, said he was pleased the Vance subpoena was put on hold. Danny Frost, a spokesman for Vance, declined to comment. The Justice Department, which opposed dismissing Trump’s challenge to the subpoena, declined to comment. Mazars did not respond to requests for comment, but has said it would comply with its legal obligations. ‘OVERREACH OF EXECUTIVE POWER’ In his decision, Marrero, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, declined to assert jurisdiction over the Vance subpoena, saying Trump should have brought his case in a New York state court. But the judge made clear that if the appeals court disagreed with that finding, Trump should lose. Marrero said the president failed to show that enforcing the subpoena would interfere with his presidential duties, cause irreparable harm or be against the public interest. He also rejected as too broad the idea of shielding Trump, his family and his businesses from criminal process. “The expansive notion of constitutional immunity invoked here to shield the President from judicial process would constitute an overreach of executive power,” Marrero wrote. Marrero said even President Richard Nixon conceded during the Watergate scandal that he would be required to produce documents in response to a judicial subpoena. Trump’s lawyers said the case raised “momentous” questions about the president’s immunity and complying with the subpoena would cause irreversible damage.

173,Southwest pilots sue Boeing for misleading them on 737 MAX,"The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA) said on Monday it had filed a lawsuit against Boeing Co alleging that the planemaker “deliberately misled” the airline and pilots about its 737 MAX aircraft. FILE PHOTO: A number of grounded Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft are shown parked at Victorville Airport in Victorville, California, U.S., March 26, 2019.  REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoThe grounding of the 737 MAX in March has wiped out more than 30,000 Southwest Airlines flights, causing over $100 million in lost wages for pilots, the union said.  Southwest is the largest operator of the MAX with 34 jetliners in its fleet when the aircraft was grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes that together killed 346 people. The lawsuit, filed in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, alleges that Boeing “abandoned sound design and engineering practices, withheld safety critical information from regulators and deliberately misled its customers, pilots and the public about the true scope of design changes to the 737 MAX.” Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers said: “While we value our long relationship with SWAPA, we believe this lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend against it.” The planemaker will continue to work with Southwest and its pilots on efforts to safely return the MAX to service, he said. Boeing is under pressure to deliver updated software and training to regulators in order for the aircraft to fly again, and has been negotiating compensation with customers like Southwest over the financial hit from the grounding.  “We have to be able to trust Boeing to truthfully disclose the information we need to safely operate our aircraft. In the case of the 737 MAX, that absolutely did not happen,” said SWAPA president, Captain Jon Weaks.  He said it is “critical” that Boeing takes whatever time is necessary to safely return the MAX to service, but added that  pilots “should not be expected to take a significant and ever-expanding financial loss as a result of Boeing’s negligence.”  Southwest, with around 10,000 pilots represented by SWAPA, had 41 more MAX jets on order for this year alone. The budget-friendly carrier is scheduling without the MAX until at least early January, pending regulatory approval for commercial flight. Pilots at American Airlines Group, which so far has canceled MAX flights through early December, have also demanded compensation for lost pay related to the 737 MAX grounding, but have not filed a lawsuit.  Last month Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly promised the airline would share any reimbursement from Boeing over the MAX grounding with its employees.

175,"Kroger, Walgreens to stop sales of e-cigarettes amid U.S. vaping crackdown","Kroger Co and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc said on Monday they would stop selling e-cigarettes at their stores, amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of the product and reports of lung disease and some deaths linked to vaping. Their move comes weeks after Walmart Inc said it was pulling the plug on e-cigarette sales, citing growing federal, state and local regulatory complexity and uncertainty. E-cigarettes and other vaping products have been linked to a mysterious lung illness that is reported to have led to 18 deaths as of last week, with the number of confirmed and probable cases of the condition exceeding 1,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Kroger said it would discontinue sales of e-cigarettes at its stores and fuel centers after selling through its current inventory. Walgreens said it had decided to stop selling e-cigarette products at its U.S. stores as the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health officials continue to examine the issue. The drugstore chain, which earlier this year set a minimum age to sell tobacco products at 21 years, said the decision was also reflective of developing regulations in a growing number of states and municipalities. New York and Michigan have already banned the sales of flavored vaping products, while the Trump administration has announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction. Kroger operates more than 2,700 stores, including over 1,500 fuel stations, while Walgreens runs nearly 10,000 drugstores in the United States. ",Top-Nachrichten,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters

177,Death toll climbs as Iraq unrest hits Baghdad's volatile Sadr City,"Protesters began gathering in Baghdad’s Sadr City district late on Monday after overnight clashes with security forces spread to the vast, poor swath of the Iraqi capital for the first time killing 15 people. The night of violence pushed the death toll after a week of unrest to 110 people. They were mostly protesters demanding the removal of the Iraqi government and overhaul of its political class, as security forces carried out a heavy-handed crackdown on demonstrators. The spread of the violence into Sadr City on Sunday night poses a new security challenge for authorities dealing with the worst violence in the country since the Islamic State group was defeated nearly two years ago. Unrest is historically difficult to put down in Sadr City, a volatile district where about a third of Baghdad’s 8 million people live in narrow alleys, many with little access to electricity, water and jobs. Things were quieter on Monday. The military withdrew troops and handed over patrols of the district to federal police early in the day, an indication authorities want to avoid clashes with supporters of the powerful opposition cleric Moqtada al-Sadr who has called for the government to step down.     A Sadr City resident reached by phone told Reuters that the streets were calm during the day. Local militiamen were coming to inspect damage and police were deployed around the district’s neighborhoods. The uprising over the past week has abruptly ended two years of relative calm unseen in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Many Iraqis, especially young people, say entrenched government corruption means they received no benefit from returning stability after years of foreign occupation and sectarian civil war. Critics say the government’s fierce response to the protests has inflamed public rage.  Reuters journalists have witnessed protesters being killed and wounded by snipers from the security forces firing into crowds from rooftops though the interior ministry denies government forces have shot directly at protesters.  The internet has been shut down across the country for days, creating a communications vacuum that allowed discontent to spread. It was restored for a few hours on Monday evening, and people uploaded recent protest footage to social media before it went down again. “The crackdown plus the internet blackout are angering people and it won’t calm the situation,” Jassim al-Hilfi, a lawmaker from the bloc of Moqtada al-Sadr, who is boycotting parliament, told Reuters. “People will not be silenced, and the politicians are  not capable of meeting their demands.” Military vehicles of Iraqi federal police are seen in a street in Baghdad, Iraq October 7, 2019.  REUTERS/Wissm al-Okili‘DOWNFALL OF THE REGIME’ President Barham Salih, whose role is normally above the day-to-day political fray, condemned attacks on protesters and the media, and called for an investigation into the violence. “Our security forces, in its various forms, must defend and support the people,” Salih said in televised remarks. “They must firmly confront those who violated the constitution by attacking citizens and the security forces, and terrorizing the media.” In his address, he also called for ministerial changes and electoral reforms to address protesters’ grievances, adding that those affected by the violence this week should be compensated. Demonstrators have been calling for “the downfall of the regime,” echoing demands in Arab Spring protests that swept across the Middle East in 2011. It is unclear how their demands could be met by the powerful Shi’ite religious parties that have dominated the country since Saddam’s fall and show no sign of willingness to relinquish control. Those parties control armed militia which gained influence in the war against Islamic State. They also have strong backing from Iran, creating a potential international dimension to the crisis in a country that is a client and ally of both Tehran and its biggest foe, Washington. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted on Monday: “#Iran and #Iraq are two nations whose hearts & souls are tied together. ... Enemies seek to sow discord but they’ve failed & their conspiracy won’t be effective.” The protests began spontaneously in Baghdad and southern cities, without public support from any major political faction in Iraq. They have since spread to other areas, mainly populated by members of the Shi’ite majority. The unrest poses an unprecedented challenge for Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who took office last year as a consensus candidate of the Shi’ite parties. REFORM PROMISES U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Abdul Mahdi in a phone call that he trusted the Iraqi forces and supported the Iraqi government in restoring security, a statement from the prime minister’s office said. Abdul Mahdi said life had returned to normal, according to the statement. The government has offered to spend more money on subsidized housing for the poor, stipends for the unemployed and training programs and loan initiatives for youth. Iraqi authorities said they would hold to account members of the security forces who “acted wrongly” in the crackdown on protests, state TV reported.  Slideshow (10 Images)The ministry also said authorities condemned all attacks against media outlets, after reports of raids at the offices of several local and international news outlets. Iraq’s National Union of Journalists condemned the attacks, and the harassment and arrests of journalists covering the protests.

178,White House hopeful Harris revs up Iowa ground game as poll numbers slide,"U.S. Senator Kamala Harris is ramping up her ground operations in the crucial early voting state of Iowa as backers and advisers fret over growing risks of the once-rising star becoming an afterthought in the crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders. Harris, 54, has positioned herself as a unifying candidate who can energize the party’s base of young, diverse progressives, while also appealing to more moderate voters. If elected in November 2020, the U.S. senator and former California attorney general would be the first black woman to become U.S. president. Yet after climbing into double digits in opinion polls following a strong debate performance in June, Harris has slid out of the top tier in recent months and lags behind leading candidates’ fundraising hauls. Two advisers cited stumbles over her healthcare position, inadequate response to criticism of her record as a prosecutor and the rise of rival U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren as contributors to the slide. Concerned by the sagging support nationally as well as in states such as Iowa - where she has fallen to fifth place in surveys from as high as second place in July - local staffers and Democrats have been pressing Harris to spend more time there. Iowa holds its caucuses on Feb. 3, the critical first vote in the state-by-state nominating contest to pick a challenger to Republican President Donald Trump next year. Since Iowa began holding its caucus in 1972, only candidates who have placed in the top three have gone on to win their party’s nomination. The Harris campaign is doubling the numbers of staffers in Iowa to about 130 and opening an additional 10 offices for a total of 17 in the state. Harris will visit Iowa every week in October, said Deidre DeJear, Harris’ Iowa campaign chairwoman. Harris also is beefing up her national staff, moving the chief of staff of her U.S. Senate office, Rohini Kosoglu, to the campaign as a top adviser, an aide to the campaign said on Tuesday. The campaign plans to double its staff in South Carolina, another early voting state, by the end of November. Several sources close to Harris’ campaign said she always intended to increase her presence in Iowa this autumn but that her drop in the polls had given her campaign and backers a greater sense of urgency. TARGETING THIRD PLACE IN IOWA Kurt Meyer, the Democratic Party chairman of three rural counties north of Des Moines, Iowa’s most populous city, said he had urged campaign aides to increase Harris’ presence in Iowa earlier. “I fear decisions are being made in Washington or California by people who don’t spend a lot of time in Iowa,” said Meyer, who has not endorsed Harris but called her a “very compelling candidate.” A Sept. 21 poll by the Des Moines Register showed Harris with the support of 6% of likely caucus-goers, behind Warren at 22%, former Vice President Joe Biden with 20%, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders at 11% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 9%.  “I’m not thrilled about it,” Sue Dvorsky, a former Iowa state party chairwoman who has endorsed Harris, said of the senator’s fifth-place status.  The campaign’s goal is for Harris to place at least third in Iowa, a feat that will take a huge ground game as well as a packed schedule of in-person campaigning, said Dvorsky, who along with her husband was an early backer of Barack Obama in his successful 2008 White House campaign. Harris’ poll numbers have persuaded her team to become “more intentional” about Iowa, Dvorsky said. “They realized they’re going to have to pay special attention to this place,” she said. DeJear, the Iowa campaign chairwoman, said it was far too early to get concerned about poll numbers. Advisers have pointed to Obama’s late surge that saw him capture Iowa on the way to winning the White House in 2008. Still, advisers acknowledged boosting Harris’ campaign in Iowa and nationally would take sharp focus - and a bit of luck.  “I’d be lying if I told you it was right where we wanted it to be,” said a longtime Harris adviser who requested anonymity in order to speak frankly. “It’s going to take a lot of things to go right for her and a lot of things to go wrong for other people,” the adviser added. BEHIND IN FUNDRAISING, POLLS After Harris spent considerable time during the summer meeting with donors, her campaign said on Tuesday she had raised $11.6 million in the third quarter, less than half of what Sanders raised and millions short of her close rival Buttigieg’s figure. Recent polls have not been kind to Harris. She earned just 4% support from Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in a national Reuters/Ipsos poll taken from last Thursday to Monday, putting her behind Biden, Sanders and Warren. In Iowa, the Harris campaign will try to increase support by reaching out to those who do not normally participate in the caucuses, including young voters, people of color and disabled voters, DeJear said.

REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File PhotoDemocratic strategist Jeff Link, co-founder of the progressive group Focus on Rural America, said Harris also needed to spend more time with rural voters, not just to do well in the caucus but also in the general election should she become the party’s nominee. Harris’ campaign said her August bus tour of the state included a visit with farmers in Lacona, Iowa. Last week, the candidate herself said there would be more such meetings ahead. “I’m going to Iowa and I’m spending time with the farmers in Iowa,” Harris told diners at a Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles. “They’re the same as the farmers in California. Same concerns, same issues, right?”   ",Politik,2019-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
179,Democratic presidential contender Warren outlines proposed 'lobbying' tax,"Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday proposed taxing any corporation or organization that spends more than $500,000 annually in lobbying the federal government, expanding on her plan she has said would “end lobbying as we know it.” Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, has centered her campaign on rooting out corruption in Washington. She has steadily risen in opinion polling this year, challenging fellow liberal U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the No. 2 spot behind former Vice President Joe Biden. She previously said she would impose an excessive lobbying tax as part of a broader anti-corruption plan that would also bar most federal officials for life from serving as lobbyists, prevent lobbyists from donating to candidates and outlawing lobbying on behalf of foreign entities. On Wednesday, she outlined the details of the tax, which would impose a 35% rate on lobbying spending between $500,000 and $1 million, 60% between $1 million and $5 million, and 75% on all spending in excess of $5 million. If such a tax scheme had been in place over the past decade, it would have affected more than 1,600 organizations, raising $10 billion, according to the campaign. Warren said she would use the revenue from the tax to establish a “lobbying defense trust fund” to help congressional agencies push back against corporate influence and an Office of the Public Advocate to elevate the viewpoints of working Americans when agencies are writing new regulations. “Corporate lobbyists are experts at killing widely popular policies behind closed doors,” Warren wrote in announcing the proposal.

180,Two U.S. officials will give depositions in House impeachment probe,"Two officials who had been asked to testify in the impeachment investigation of U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to provide depositions, an official with a Democratic-led House of Representatives committee said on Tuesday. Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch will give a deposition on Oct. 11, according to the committee official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump’s former special representative for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, will appear before the panel on Thursday, the official said. Following a whistleblower complaint last week, Democrats are looking into Trump’s request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a July 25 phone call to investigate a domestic political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is a leading Democratic contender in the contest to run against Republican Trump in the 2020 election. The unidentified whistleblower is said to be an intelligence agent who accused Trump of soliciting foreign interference for his personal political benefit. Earlier on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushed back on House Democrats’ efforts to get the depositions from State Department officials, accusing the lawmakers of bullying and intimidation. The officials “may not attend any interview or deposition” without executive branch counsel present to control disclosure of confidential information, Pompeo wrote in a letter to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel. Engel and two other Democratic committee chairmen issued a statement accusing Pompeo of “stonewalling” the impeachment inquiry, and called him a “fact witness” in the investigation, based on media reports that he had listened in on Trump’s call with Zelenskiy. “He should immediately cease intimidating department witnesses in order to protect himself and the president,” Engel and Representatives Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings said. There was no immediate word on whether three other officials  had agreed to requests to appear before the committees. They are Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The State Department’s inspector general, Steve Linick, will give an urgent briefing on Wednesday to staff members from several House and Senate committees about documents obtained from the department’s Office of the Legal Adviser related to the State Department and Ukraine, a source familiar with the briefing said. The briefing was requested by Linick. RESIGNATION Volker resigned last week after the whistleblower named him as one of two U.S. diplomats who followed up with Ukrainian officials a day after the Trump-Zelenskiy call. Verwandte ThemenUkraine investigates former top prosecutor over involvement in illegal gamblingU.S. House committees seek to hold line on Pompeo in impeachment probeSee more stories The call occurred after Trump froze nearly $400 million in aid intended to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian-backed separatists. Zelenskiy agreed during the call to investigate Biden and his son Hunter and expressed interest in buying more U.S. arms in the form of Javelin anti-tank missiles. Hunter Biden had served as a director of a Ukrainian gas company.  The funds were later provided and a U.S. congressional aide said on Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to buy 150 Javelin missiles, made by Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Corp, in a deal worth $39 million. Leaders of congressional committees signed off on the sale in the past week under an informal review process for major international military sales. The impeachment inquiry could lead to approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. That would lead to a trial in the Senate on whether to remove him from office. But the president’s fellow Republicans control that chamber and have shown little appetite for removing him. Pompeo, who is in Italy for a three-day trip, objected to Engel’s request for the officials to be made available for depositions. In a letter posted on Twitter, Pompeo told Engel: “I am concerned with aspects of your request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully and treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career Foreign Service Officers, whom the committee is now targeting.” Pompeo expressed “significant legal and procedural concerns” and said he viewed a committee letter to the officials as a “request for a voluntary appearance.” Pompeo said the announced dates for the depositions did not provide enough time for preparation. He also said his department would respond to a Foreign Affairs Committee subpoena by Friday.  He said records that have been requested are subject to restrictions relating to classified information and other executive branch privileges. Pompeo added that there was no legal basis for the committee’s assertion that a failure to appear would constitute evidence of obstruction. Pompeo said he would use “all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals” at the State Department. ‘EVIDENCE OF OBSTRUCTION’ Pompeo’s letter marked the latest bid by Trump’s administration to avoid providing House Democrats testimony and documents relating to numerous investigations of the president. Democrats have accused Trump of a policy of stonewalling legitimate congressional inquiries. “Any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress - including State Department employees - is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry,” the three Democratic chairmen said. Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Trump continued on Tuesday to assail the impeachment inquiry and defend his call with Zelenskiy. The president asked on Twitter: “Why aren’t we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him.” Trump also wrote that Schiff should be “brought up on charges.” A senior Republican senator, Chuck Grassley, came to the defense of the whistleblower.

181,Wall Street falls amid caution on U.S.-China trade dispute,"U.S. stocks eased on Monday as reports on the U.S.-China trade front kept investors cautious ahead of scheduled talks later in the week. A report that Beijing was increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by President Donald Trump weighed on sentiment early. But White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow helped ease some anxiety, saying it was possible U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators could make progress when they meet in Washington, and said the United States was open to looking at what proposals Beijing brought.  Stocks briefly traded higher in the afternoon after a Fox reporter tweeted that the Chinese commerce ministry said China is ready to do a deal with the United States on parts of negotiations. U.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators launched a new round of talks on Monday aimed at resolving the two nations’ 15-month trade war, while the White House officially confirmed that the high-level talks, involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would begin on Thursday. “The markets are trying to come up with some expectation for the outcome of trade talks and figure out where and how they want to price it in,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 95.7 points, or 0.36%, to 26,478.02, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 13.22 points, or 0.45%, to 2,938.79 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 26.18 points, or 0.33%, to 7,956.29. Tariff concessions from the United States and China last month had fueled hopes of a resolution to the prolonged dispute.  Anxiety over the trade war and mixed economic indicators has been offset by increased expectations of a third interest rate cut this year by the Federal Reserve. “We had a pretty good rally back from the lows on Friday, and we’re sort of back into the middle of the recent trading range,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.  “Investors are trying to balance what seems like a weaker economy with low interest rates. What could change it could be something coming out of the talks with China this week.” Investors will soon turn their focus to third-quarter earnings, which begin next week with U.S. banks reporting, and many hope to see more clarity on the impact of the trade war on corporate America. Analysts expect the lowest quarterly profit performance since 2016, with S&P 500 earnings seen falling nearly 3% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.

183,UK's Johnson tells EU: Brexit ball is in your court now,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the European Union on Monday that the Brexit ball was in its court and that the bloc should now urgently discuss in detail his proposal for breaking the deadlock in talks ahead of Britain’s departure on Oct. 31. With just 24 days to go before the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU, both sides are positioning themselves to avoid blame for a delay or a disorderly no-deal Brexit.  EU leaders reacted coolly to Johnson’s last-ditch proposals to bridge the impasse, indicating just how far apart the two sides are over the first departure of a sovereign state from the EU, which was forged from Europe’s ruins after World War Two. “What we’re saying to our friends is (that) this is a very generous, fair and reasonable offer we’ve made. What we’d like to hear from you now is what your thoughts are,” Johnson said. “If you have issues with any of the proposals that we’ve come up with, then let’s get into the detail and discuss them,” he told reporters, reiterating his position that the United Kingdom would leave the EU on Oct. 31.  At stake, potentially, are the unity of the United Kingdom, peace on the island of Ireland, global growth and the future shape of the European project. Johnson has repeatedly vowed that Britain will leave the bloc on Oct. 31 and that he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than seek any further extension of the departure date. A law passed by his political opponents requires him to write to the EU requesting a delay if he has failed to agree a deal by Oct. 19, the day after an EU summit of all 28 national leaders in Brussels.  A Scottish court on Monday rejected a bid by campaigners seeking an order to force Johnson to ask for a Brexit delay, citing assurances given to the court by the government that it would comply with the law. Verwandte ThemenCan Blockchain solve Brexit's border puzzle? Experts are skepticalFormer UK Conservative lawmaker joins pro-EU liberal democratsSee more stories BREXIT DEAL? Johnson made his proposal to the EU last Wednesday, offering a possible compromise on the Irish border - the most contentious issue - that drew cool reception from the EU. He went further than many had expected on trying to solve the dilemma over the border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland by proposing an all-island regulatory zone to cover all goods. This would replace the so-called “backstop” arrangement he says Britain cannot accept. However, Northern Ireland would leave the EU’s customs area along with the rest of the UK and the province’s institutions would be able to opt to exit the regulatory zone - a step too far for Ireland and the EU. “That’s a no-go,” said a diplomat dealing with Brexit in  Brussels. “Unless they move towards accepting a genuine backstop to cover all of Northern Ireland in all aspects and with no limitations, I see no chance for a deal.” “There will not be a deal compromising the single market, this is a foundation of the whole of the EU.” The backstop aims to avoid the imposition of any border checks on the island of Ireland after Brexit. Johnson argues that it would split Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom or else trap the whole UK in the EU’s orbit for years. Johnson outlined his latest proposals in a telephone call to French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday, an Elysee official said. Macron said the EU would evaluate progress at the end of the week, a message reinforced by others in the bloc on Monday. “The political reality is that we should know by the end of the week whether we are still in deal-making mode or not,” said an EU official.      The EU must match the compromises made by Britain to secure a Brexit deal, Johnson’s spokesman said on Monday. “We are ready to talk to the EU at pace to secure a deal so that we can move on and build a new partnership between the UK and the EU, but if this is to be possible, the EU must match the compromises that the UK has made,” the spokesman said. But the EU has multiple issues with the London proposal. Slideshow (2 Images)They zero in on the Northern Irish authorities’ role; the envisaged arrangements for customs, VAT and excise tax; just competition clauses; as well as a general commitment proposed by Britain that neither side would ever introduce border checks on the sensitive Irish frontier. The EU says that risks tying its hands while at the same time not providing any workable solution to keep the border open. ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-06 00:00:00,Reuters

185,"Stocks fall, dollar rises as investors worry about trade","Wall Street equity indexes ended a volatile session lower on Monday while oil prices gave up early gains and the dollar rose as investors looked for safety ahead of U.S.-China trade talks.  FILE PHOTO: A trader works as a screen shows market data behind him at CMC markets in London, Britain, December 11, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File PhotoU.S. Treasury yields rose as $78 billion in note and bond supply slated for auction this week helped push prices lower after last week’s dramatic rise.  As deputy level U.S.-China trade talks kicked off on Monday, the White House confirmed that high-level talks involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would start on Thursday. Late in the session, Wall Street’s major indexes briefly turned higher after positive tweets about the trade talks. But they then sank again as hopes for progress faded. Without a clear bet to make on the trade talks outcome, investors appeared to see the dollar as the safest place, according to Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey. “You can expect this (volatility) all week leading up to the discussions with China on trade. Markets are trying to front run the outcome,” said Cruz. “Bonds and stocks will be volatile this week. Investors don’t know one way or another what the outcome of trade discussions will be, so they’re moving out of both.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 95.7 points, or 0.36%, to 26,478.02, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 13.22 points, or 0.45%, to 2,938.79 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 26.18 points, or 0.33%, to 7,956.29.

The dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies, but Turkey’s lira slid to its lowest level against the dollar in more than a month after the White House said Ankara would soon launch unilateral military operations in northeast Syria.  The Turkish lira lost 2.45% versus the U.S. dollar at 5.84, its weakest in over a month. A move above 5.8577 would send the currency to its weakest since June.

186,U.S. authorities protecting whistleblower in Trump-Ukraine matter: source,"U.S. authorities have taken security measures to protect a U.S. intelligence official who filed a whistleblower complaint that sparked an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, a source familiar with the case told Reuters.  Lawyers for the whistleblower expressed concern in a Sept. 28 letter to the acting director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, that their client’s safety could be at risk after Trump suggested he was a spy who had committed treason. They said certain individuals had offered a $50,000 “bounty” for any information on the whistleblower’s identity after the official complained to a government watchdog that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. The U.S. government source familiar with the whistleblower’s case said federal authorities were taking precautions to protect the official, but declined to say what measures had been put in place.

187,U.S. Republicans join Democrats to blast Trump's Syria withdrawal,"In a rare show of bipartisanship, the top lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate on Monday condemned President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, which could open the way for a Turkish strike on Kurdish-led fighters in the area. Some threatened to introduce a resolution calling for Trump to reverse the move or legislation imposing sanctions on Turkey if it attacked Kurdish forces. Kurdish soldiers have helped the United States fight the Islamic State militant group, but the Turkish military has branded them terrorists. “This decision poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement calling on Trump to “reverse this dangerous decision.” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement: “A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.” McConnell was referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. McConnell also noted in his statement that most of the Senate voted in January for an amendment expressing bipartisan concern about the continuing threat posed by Islamic militant groups in Syria and support for a continued military presence. “The conditions that produced that bipartisan vote still exist today,” he said. The United States on Monday began pulling troops back from northeastern Syria’s border, effectively giving Turkey a green light to move into the area, after Trump’s surprise announcement on Sunday that he was withdrawing U.S. forces.  Many Congress members from both parties quickly condemned the move, a departure from the deep partisan divide that has opened at the U.S. Capitol, worsened by House Democrats’ decision to open an impeachment investigation of the Republican president. Slideshow (3 Images)On Monday, several Republicans better known for their strong backing of Trump also expressed outrage over the decision. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called the situation “a disaster in the making” that showed the United States is an unreliable ally. Graham said he would introduce a Senate resolution opposing the plan and asking for a reversal. He also said he and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen planned to introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if it invades Syria and will call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces. Later on Monday, however, Trump threatened to destroy Turkey’s economy if it took its planned military strike too far. ",Politik,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters
188,Macri seeks boost from young voters with employer tax cut incentive,"Argentine President Mauricio Macri announced a tax incentive proposal aimed at boosting employment among young people on Monday, in a bid to gain ground with a voter demographic that contributed to his poor showing in an August primary.  FILE PHOTO: Argentina's President Mauricio Macri holds up a sign beside first lady Juliana Awada at a campaign rally in Buenos Aires, Argentina, September 28, 2019. The sign reads: ""Yes we can"". REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/File PhotoMacri, in the final stages of his re-election campaign, said in a series of tweets he would propose a year-long tax break of 100% for employers that hire workers aged between 17 and 24 who are seeking their first jobs, or who have less than a year of work experience. Employers would receive a 75% tax cut in the second year as part of the incentive to hire young people.  “Young people in Argentina face many barriers to getting their first job. We will lower taxes to make it easier to access quality work,” Macri tweeted. He offered no further details on how the tax break would apply to employers, but a press release sent by Macri’s coalition said a company that hires an eligible young worker who earns 35,000 pesos monthy would receive a tax break of 5,500 pesos per month. The proposal by Macri, whose voters are typically over the age of 50, signals an attempt to target an important voting bloc just 20 days before an election he is widely expected to lose.   Macri’s resounding defeat in the Aug. 11 primary vote by Peronist opponent Alberto Fernandez came as a shock to pollsters who predicted a much narrower difference between the candidates.  Following the surprise result, some pollsters acknowledged that poor data on the voting intentions of young people were a major factor in the inaccurate predictions. As one of the demographics most impacted by poverty and unemployment, young voters are less likely to have internet access or a conventional phone where canvassers can reach them. Most only use cellphones, making it harder for pollsters to contact them. Young voters are more likely to be supporters of left-leaning Peronist candidates, political analysts said, as many grew up with generous social spending under the previous administration of former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, and her predecessor and late husband, President Nestor Kirchner. Fernandez de Kirchner is now Alberto Fernandez’s vice presidential running-mate.   Macri’s uphill battle for a second term comes as Argentina is gripped by an economic crisis that has increased unemployment to 10.6% and sent inflation sky-rocketing to nearly 55%.

FILE PHOTO: Anders Olsson, the acting permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, announces that the Swedish Academy postpones the award of 2018 Nobel literature prize, during an interview to the Swedish newsagency TT News Agency, in Stockholm, Sweden, May 4, 2018. TT News Agency/Janerik Henriksson/via REUTERS The Swedish Academy was forced to shelve the 2018 prize when it was engulfed by rape accusations against the husband of an Academy member. The 233-year-old Academy has since made changes it billed as improving its transparency and clearing the way for the double awards on Thursday. But the Nobel Foundation, which funds the literary world’s most prestigious, $914,000 prize, said the Academy - whose members are elected for life and statutes can be changed only with the approval of Sweden’s king, needed to do more.  “I think they can, and to some extent they have already begun doing so, act more openly than they have done in the past and I think that would be a good thing,” said Lars Heikensten, executive director of the Nobel Foundation. “We have also agreed with the Academy that they should review the lifetime membership and test out ideas on limited terms of office,” he told Reuters. Heikensten forced the Academy to postpone the 2018 award and bring outside experts onto its awards panel. Only this May did he give the Academy a green light to award a winner for 2019. “Our reputation is everything,” Heikensten said. “Obviously, it is important to avoid this kind of situation we have been in and of course it cannot be repeated.” To that end the Nobel Foundation has been drafting a common code of conduct for all prize-awarding bodies. It will cover aspects like ensuring the names of laureates under consideration are kept secret, conflicts of interest, and nepotism. “There have been regulations at the individual institutions, but we believe there is a value in having a common set of rules, not least that it should be clearer how the rules should be applied,” Heikensten said. The Swedish Academy declined to comment for this article. Among this year’s award favorites with bookmakers are Canadian poet Anne Carson, novelist Maryse Condé from the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, and Japanese author Haruki Murakami.  Graphic of Nobel laureates: here REFORMS Under the Academy’s reforms, members can now voluntarily resign and several have done so, including Katarina Frostenson, a poet whose husband is now serving a prison term for rape and was also accused of leaking the names of several prize winners. Previously, some members who tired of their duties just stopped coming to meetings and could not be replaced until they died. Some Academy members had been inactive for many years. “More change is needed. I would like to see a more comprehensive reform of the Academy,” said Ingrid Elam, literature professor at Gothenburg University, adding that an age limit would be essential for the reputation of the prize. “They should set an age limit of 80 for members and work much more with time-limited committees. People have a tendency to award only for what they already know about and to think that (other works) are kitsch, not art, or just not good enough.” ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters

REUTERS/Tom BrennerMueller, 75, is rejoining WilmerHale as a partner focused on high-profile investigations and crisis management, similar to his work prior to becoming special counsel, the law firm said on Tuesday. Two other lawyers who left WilmerHale to work in the special counsel’s office, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley, are also returning, as partners. The law firm has about 1,000 lawyers. “It was an honor to serve as special counsel,” Mueller said in a statement provided by the firm. “I look forward to resuming my private practice.” Mueller was a WilmerHale partner in Washington for three years before his May 2017 appointment as special counsel, and had been a partner at a predecessor firm in the mid-1990s. He was also FBI director from 2001 to 2013, becoming that agency’s longest-serving director other than J. Edgar Hoover. Mueller spent 22 months investigating what he concluded was “sweeping” Russian interference in the 2016 election, and told Congress on July 24 that Russia would keep trying to interfere in U.S. elections. “They’re doing it as we sit here,” Mueller said, “and they expect to do it during the next campaign.”  The probe also focused on Trump’s alleged efforts to impede the inquiry. While the president said a special counsel report released in April was a “complete and total exoneration” of him, Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice.  The report also said Mueller found insufficient evidence to establish that Trump and his campaign had engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia.             ",Politik,2019-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters

Democratic presidential hopefuls also began revealing their fundraising hauls, including Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg who posted strong totals for the quarter. Trump and the RNC fundraise jointly, allowing the combined operation to accept larger donations from individuals than Democrats still vying in the primary are allowed to accept. Trump and the RNC had $156 million in cash at the end of September, a war chest that allows him to spend aggressively in the early days of the campaign to attempt to gain an advantage on the eventual Democratic nominee before the primary contest is over. Trump is already tapping into that war chest. The RNC launched a $2 million television and digital advertising campaign over the weekend meant to respond to the impeachment inquiry of Trump that Democrats launched last week, according to a Republican source. Sanders raised $25.3 million and Buttigieg $19.1 million, their campaigns announced earlier on Tuesday. Senator Kamala Harris, who has watched her poll numbers drop off in the third quarter, announced she raised $11.6 million in the third quarter, a slight drop from the $11.8 million she raised the previous quarter. Senator Cory Booker, who has languished in the low single-digits in polls, reported that he raised more than $6 million from July through September. They were the first of the 19 candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in the November 2020 election to report their fundraising totals for the quarter, which ended at midnight on Monday. Trump’s campaign has touted their fundraising haul as evidence of the machine being built to fend off Democratic opposition.  “President Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,” campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement.  Sanders, whose status in opinion polls as the No. 2 candidate for the party’s nomination behind Joe Biden has been threatened by a surge in support for fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren, hauled in more than any Democratic candidate has raised in any quarter so far. Buttigieg, who has struggled to break into the top three spots in polls, fell short of the $24.8 million he raised in the second quarter, when he was the top fundraiser among Democratic candidates. Fundraising numbers are closely watched to assess whether campaigns are collecting the cash needed to be competitive. They must file detailed fundraising reports for the third quarter to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15. Harris, who represents California, ended September with $10 million in cash, a position her campaign argued allows her to continue to grow in the four months before the first votes are cast. Her campaign plans to double the amount of staff in the early primary state of South Carolina by the end of November. Since launching her campaign in the winter, Harris has received donations from 850,000 different donors. In the third quarter, the average donation was $34.  Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, had said he needed to raise $1.7 million in the last 10 days of the quarter to remain viable. His campaign said it raised $2.1 million from more than 46,000 donations during that final push. Sanders’ total came from 1.4 million individual donations and surpassed the $18 million he raised in the second quarter. Campaign officials pointed to the grassroots, small-dollar nature of his fundraising as a sign of the breadth of his support. Sanders quickly put some of his campaign cash to work. His campaign released his first paid television advertisement of the cycle and bought $1.3 million in air time in Iowa, which kicks off the race with the first state nominating contest on Feb. 3, 2020. Sanders has raised a total of $61.5 million since he launched his presidential bid in February.

Nearly all of Sanders’ donors have not hit their maximum allowed contribution, the campaign said, meaning they can give again. Buttigieg has raised a total of $51 million so far this year, his campaign said in a memo to reporters. The average donation in the third quarter was $32.  The South Bend, Indiana mayor’s campaign said it hired 400 new staff and opened its first 42 field offices, including 21 in Iowa, in the third quarter. ",Politik,2019-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters
193,Facebook's Zuckerberg says Warren as U.S. president would be bad for tech,"Facebook Inc Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told employees in July that the company would “go to the mat” to defeat Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren’s expected effort to break up the world’s largest social media company if she were elected president, according to audio of two internal company meetings published by The Verge. “If she (Warren) gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government,” he said, according to the leaked audio. Warren, who in March called for breaking up Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc, quickly issued a retort on Twitter. “What would really ‘suck’ is if we don’t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights,” Warren tweeted. In a later series of tweets, Warren noted that Facebook has built more market dominance in recent years by acquiring potential competitors WhatsApp and Instagram. “More than 85% of all social networking traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Facebook,” she wrote. “They’ve got a lot of power—and face little competition or accountability.  “They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, undermined our democracy, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.” In the audio, Zuckerberg said breaking up big tech companies would make election interference “more likely because now the companies can’t coordinate and work together.” Verwandte ThemenFactbox: Six things Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff in leaked audioZuckerberg also drew laughter by saying Facebook’s investment on safety is bigger than Twitter’s entire revenue.  Zuckerberg issued a statement on his Facebook page, linking to The Verge’s transcript, though he said it was meant to be internal. “You can check it out if you’re interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I’m thinking and telling employees” he wrote in the post.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has an open antitrust investigation into Facebook, and a group of state attorneys general led by New York is also investigating. Other Democratic presidential candidates have also criticized Facebook. Senator Bernie Sanders said he would look to split up Facebook, Google and Amazon, while Senator Kamala Harris said a break-up should “seriously” be considered.  Senator Amy Klobuchar, one of the lawmakers who introduced the Honest Ads Act that would force Facebook to disclose purchasers of ads on the platform, announced her campaign with a speech that criticized major tech companies.   Another senior Facebook executive told Reuters this month the company is confident it would defeat an effort to break it up.    With more than 2 billion monthly users, Facebook been under scrutiny from regulators around the world over data sharing practices. It has also come under fire for failing to prevent Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  U.S. President Donald Trump and other Republicans have criticized social media platforms for alleged bias against conservatives, which the platforms have denied.

195,Residents scramble to uproot from ancient Turkish town before dam waters rise,"In the ancient Turkish town of Hasankeyf, the Ozturk family are selling all the livestock that was their livelihood as they prepare to uproot to government-built housing across the Tigris River before the waters rise. They are among around 3,000 residents of the town who are being forced to leave by an Oct. 8 deadline to make way for the Ilisu Dam, a project two decades in the making that will generate electricity for southeast Turkey. Standing in the entrance of her house, where the family’s belongings have been piled up for the move, Sabahat Ozturk, 39, said their new apartment is not ready but they will try to move out as soon as possible. Like many others in Hasankeyf, which dates back 12,000 years, the Ozturks have been dependent on livestock farming and worry about how they will make a living in their new home.  “They took our place from us, and are forcing us to sell our herd (of sheep),” Sabahat’s father-in-law, 85-year-old Kerem Ozturk, said of the central government. “We could take care of our animals here, we were able to make ends meet. Now we have to sell them.” Not all of Hasankeyf’s residents will have moved out by Tuesday’s deadline and authorities will need to extend it, residents and activists say, further delaying the project that has faced numerous setbacks since it was launched more than 20 years ago.  In July, Turkey finally started to fill the dam further downstream on the Tigris where villages have already been vacated and are now partially submerged. Water is expected to start rising in Hasankeyf, located in the southeastern province of Batman, in the next few months.  The Ilisu Dam, expected to be operational for 50 years, will generate 1,200 megawatts of electricity, making it Turkey’s fourth-largest dam in terms of energy production. But it has been criticized by activists who say the dam, once completely filled, will have displaced 78,000 people from 199 surrounding villages and risks creating water shortages downstream in Iraq. Hasankeyf was used by the Romans as a fortress town to ward off Persians. The town was later destroyed by Mongols and rebuilt in the 11th century by Seljuk Turks. The Ozturks’ home is perched on a ledge on a cliffside. It has a clear view of works to construct a wall below the ancient Hasankeyf fortress, which dates back to the 4th century BC.  Below their home, archaeologists are working on a digging site, while above the wall, lie caves where people used to live.

REUTERS/Sertac KayarNEW TOWN The Ozturk family have been allocated an apartment in Yeni Hasankeyf - or New Hasankeyf - across the river from the old town where a hospital, an elementary school and government buildings are already up and running. Parks and playgrounds for children have also been built and trees planted. In a bid to attract tourists to the area, eight historic structures, including a massive tomb, an ancient Turkish bath, a historic mosque and its minaret, have been moved from the old town to Yeni Hasankeyf. The head of the Hasankeyf Cultural Foundation, Ahmet Akdeniz - or Ahmet the Shepherd as he is known to locals - has moved into a house in Yeni Hasankeyf but remembers living in the caves as a child, sitting by a fireplace to eat and warm up, before people started moving to homes in the old town in the 1970s. Akdeniz, 52, supports the Yeni Hasankeyf project and believes it will increase tourism in the area. But while the houses look pristine from the outside, they were made with low-quality building materials and residents have issues with the water supply, he said. “Water is leaking everywhere except from the tap!” he says. LONE RESIDENT Some people who have already moved to Yeni Hasankeyf have built coops outside their apartment buildings for their chickens, although the town is mostly empty and still under construction. “What are we going to do without a job?” says Cemil Yavanas, 57, as he carries disassembled wardrobes out of his house in Hasankeyf old town. He makes a living selling vegetables but will have no land once he moves to the new town. Further down the Tigris River the village of Celikkoy, located 15 km (9.3 miles) north of the dam in the southeastern province of Mardin, is almost fully submerged by the rising waters. Slideshow (6 Images)The government started filling the dam in July without notifying anyone in advance, said Mehmet Selim Acar, 65, who has remained in Celikkoy, moving into a dilapidated former gendarmerie command post without electricity on a hill above the village. The other residents have all left, but Acar, who also has an apartment in Batman, wanted to stay because his ancestors lived in the village. Since he retired from his job at a government office, he has made a living from agriculture.  “I had one ton of pomegranates, pears, 5-6 tonnes of grapes. I had to leave them,” he said, recalling when his old home was flooded. “There was nowhere I could go to to file a complaint.” ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters
196,"U.S. Supreme Court opens new term, with an ill Justice Thomas absent","The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday debated the insanity defense in criminal prosecutions and delivered a potential setback to gun control advocates as it opened its new term on Monday with a flurry of activity on a day when its longest-serving justice, Clarence Thomas, was absent due to illness. The conservative-majority court returned after a three-month break to launch its new nine-month term with arguments in a trio of cases. The court hears the term’s first major case on Tuesday on whether a landmark federal anti-discrimination law that bars sex discrimination in the workplace protects gay and transgender employees. In remarks from the bench before the first argument, Chief Justice John Roberts said Thomas was “indisposed” due to illness but would participate in deciding the cases argued on Monday. A court spokeswoman said Thomas, 71, likely has the flu. One of the nine-member court’s most conservative justices, Thomas has served since 1991. The court said it would not cancel its scheduled Dec. 2 arguments, as requested by New York City, in a lawsuit by gun owners and the state’s National Rifle Association affiliate challenging restrictions on handgun owners transporting firearms outside the home. The city had asked the justices to ditch the arguments because its measure was recently amended, meaning there was no longer any reason to hear the dispute. Hearing the case could enable the court’s conservative majority to rule against a gun control measure, although the justices also still could dismiss it after the arguments. During Monday’s first argument, the justices wrestled with the insanity defense, which bars holding criminally responsible mentally impaired defendants who do not know right from wrong. They seemed divided over a Kansas law, enacted in 1996, that prevents defendants from arguing insanity. The law lets defendants argue that, due to mental illness, they could not have intended to commit the crime. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 86, asked the first question and appeared vigorous after undergoing radiation therapy in August to treat a cancerous tumor on her pancreas. The case involved James Kraig Kahler, sentenced to death in Kansas for the 2009 fatal shootings of four family members. He shot his wife and two teenage daughters with a high-powered rifle at the home of his wife’s grandmother, who he also killed. He spared his son, who was 9 years old. Kahler was diagnosed with major depression and obsessive personality disorder. A psychiatric expert hired by the defense said Kahler’s illness was so severe he “lost control” of his actions.  In Kansas, he could not claim he was not guilty by reason of insanity. He challenged the measure as a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment guarantee of due process under the law and the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. His conviction was upheld by the state’s top court.  ‘MORALLY WRONG’ Conservative Justice Samuel Alito said it has been calculated that one in five Americans has some sort of mental disorder. “All of them could go to the jury on the question of whether they had the capacity to know that what they were doing when they committed the crime was morally wrong,” Alito said.  Several justices pointed to the long history of the insanity defense in U.S. law. “If it’s historically established that you cannot punish people who don’t know the difference between right and wrong, that certainly sounds like something that is rooted in the conscience and would be ranked as fundamental,” said Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative.  Idaho, Montana and Utah also have abandoned the insanity defense. Other states, the District of Columbia and the federal criminal justice system allow it. A ruling is due by the end of June. The other two arguments on Monday focused on whether the Constitution requires unanimous jury verdicts and on fees in patent litigation. In the jury verdicts dispute, the court appeared likely to rule in favor of Louisiana inmate Evangelisto Ramos, who was convicted on a 10-2 jury vote in a 2014 murder. The court is weighing whether Constitution’s Sixth Amendment guarantee of trial by jury requires a unanimous verdict. Only two states, Louisiana and Oregon, had allowed non-unanimous verdicts. Louisiana began prohibiting non-unanimous verdicts starting this past January, but that change did not apply retroactively. The justices turned away appeals in several business-related cases. They let a discrimination lawsuit proceed against Domino’s Pizza Inc by a blind man who accused it of violating a law barring discrimination against people with disabilities after he was unable to place an order online.

CalvertThe court spurned Amazon.com’s bid to avoid a lawsuit concerning overtime pay for workers who face lengthy post-shift security screenings.  It also rejected appeals in patent disputes including one involving Apple Inc and another involving Acorda Therapeutics Inc. The court declined to hear Las Vegas sports gambler William “Billy” Walters’ appeal of a 2017 insider trading conviction that landed him a five-year prison sentence in a case that also drew attention because of his ties to billionaire investor Carl Icahn and golfer Phil Mickelson.

197,U.S. Energy Secretary Perry denies pressing Ukraine to hire officials,"U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Monday denied a report that he had pressed Ukraine to hire certain people to the board of its state-owned natural gas company, saying he had only recommended names at the Ukrainian government’s request. The Associated Press reported that Perry had pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to fire members of the advisory board of gas company Naftogaz and then presented a list of advisers. “That the AP story basically said that we said, ‘You put these people on there’ - is just not correct. I mean that was a totally dreamed up story, the best I can tell,” Perry told a news conference in Vilnius on Monday. “We gave recommendations at the request of the Ukrainian government, and we will continue to,” he added. News website Axios has reported that Trump told House Republicans he did not want to make the July 25 call to Zelenskiy, a conversation that is at the heart of an impeachment inquiry. But it said he relented at the urging of Perry. Perry said he encouraged U.S. President Donald Trump to talk with Zelenskiy to build confidence among U.S. officials that the country was taking steps to fight corruption and improve transparency. “Absolutely, I asked the president multiple times - ‘Mr President, we think it is in the United States and the Ukraine’s best interest, that you and the president of Ukraine have conversations, that you discuss the options that are there.’ So absolutely, yes,” Perry said in Vilnius. During the call in July, Trump pressed Zelenskiy for an investigation into former U.S. vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, according to a call summary released by the Trump administration.

198,"Fearing Islamic State revival, France warns U.S., Turkey after Syria moves","The U.S. decision to withdraw from northeastern Syria leaving Turkey to launch an offensive against Kurdish militants in the region could open the door to a revival of Islamic State, France’s armed forces minister said on Monday. France is one of Washington’s main allies in the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, with its warplanes used to strike militant targets and its special forces on the ground coordinating with local Kurdish and Arab fighters. The United States began pulling troops back from the northeast Syria border on Monday, in a move U.S. President Donald Trump hailed as a bid to quit “endless wars”. The move appeared to leave allies scrambling to assess the impact. “We are going to be extremely careful that this announced disengagement from the United States and a possible offensive by Turkey does not create a dangerous maneuver that diverts from the goal we all pursue - the fight against Islamic State - and which is dangerous for the local population,” Florence Parly told reporters in northern France.  “We must be extremely vigilant that a maneuver of this kind can not, contrary to the goal of the coalition, strengthen Daesch (Islamic State) rather than weaken it and eradicate it,” she said. French officials have said in the past that a U.S. withdrawal would force Paris to also draw back its troops and after a similar an announcement by Trump in January, French President Emmanuel Macron had claimed he had convinced Trump to change his mind. France is especially sensitive to the Islamic State threat after several major deadly attacks on its soil and officials believe the militant group continues to pose a threat. Hundreds of French nationals joined the group in Syria and are currently being held in Kurdish-controlled camps. With an impending Turkish attack, the Kurds could be forced to reduce security at those camps. “Terrorist fighters in detention, including those of foreign nationality, must be tried in the place where they committed their crimes,” France’s foreign ministry spokeswoman told reporters, warning Ankara against a unilateral operation. “This judgment and their secure detention in north-east Syria are a security imperative to prevent them from reinforcing the ranks of terrorist groups,” she added.

Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey apologized on Monday for his tweet, which he quickly deleted over the weekend, but his support for the demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled city angered China’s government and others in the world’s No. 2 economy.

Some 300 million people play the game in China, NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum said in an interview with Reuters earlier this month.  - The NBA has had a presence in China since 1992 when it opened its first office in Hong Kong. It now has relationships with a number of television and digital media outlets throughout China, including a three-decade partnership with CCTV, the league said. - The Houston Rockets are widely followed in China after the franchise drafted Chinese player Yao Ming with the first overall pick in the 2002 draft. Yao became a star and helped build the NBA’s following in China. The eight-time NBA All-Star was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.  - NBA China, which conducts the league’s business in the country, was launched in 2008. It is now worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.     - Since 2014, 17 NBA teams have played 26 games in Beijing, Guangzhou, Macao, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Taipei. Los Angeles Lakers, led by four-time NBA MVP LeBron James, will play a pair of exhibition games against the Brooklyn Nets in China in October. - The NBA and Tencent, a Chinese media outlet which provides a live streaming platform, announced a five-year extension of a partnership through the 2024-25 season. The deal is worth a reported $1.5 billion while Tencent has estimated that there are about 500 million fans in China consuming NBA content, ESPN reported.   - NBA franchises gained 47 million new followers on Chinese social media platforms during the 2018-19 season, according to the league’s annual report on teams’ digital performance.

203,U.S. House impeachment probe intensifies as Trump rages about inquiry,"The U.S. House of Representatives’ impeachment probe into President Donald Trump intensified on Monday, as Trump raged about the inquiry and news reports suggested he had used additional diplomatic channels to go after his adversaries.   Three House committees said a subpoena for documents had been sent to Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. The former New York mayor had said on television he asked the government of Ukraine to “target” former Vice President Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Trump in the 2020 election. Giuliani said in a tweet the subpoena raised legal issues including attorney-client privilege. “It will be given appropriate consideration,” he added. The Democratic-led House initiated an impeachment inquiry against Trump last week after a whistleblower report raised concerns that Trump tried to leverage nearly $400 million in U.S. aid in exchange for investigating Biden from Ukraine’s leader in July. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took part in the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which the matter was discussed, the Wall Street Journal reported, something likely to draw the attention of House investigators. The New York Times reported that Trump had sought the help of another world leader, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, with a U.S. Justice Department probe into the origins of what became Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. In a recent telephone call, Trump asked Morrison to assist Attorney General William Barr with the probe, which Trump hopes will discredit Mueller’s now-closed investigation, the Times reported.  “The Democrats clearly don’t want the truth to come out anymore as it might hurt them politically, but this call relates to a DOJ inquiry publicly announced months ago to uncover exactly what happened,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in response to the Times story.  An Australian government spokesperson said in an email:  “The Australian Government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation. The PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the President.” Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials in Britain and Italy to seek their assistance as well with that investigation, the Washington Post reported.  In the Giuliani document request, the chairmen of three House committees said he had “stated more recently that you are in possession of evidence - in the form of text messages, phone records, and other communications - indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump Administration officials may have been involved in this scheme.”  Verwandte ThemenU.S. Democrats subpoena Trump lawyer Giuliani in impeachment probeTrump contacted foreign officials over probe of Russia inquiry origins -Justice DeptSee more stories He was given until Oct. 15 to respond.   SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT RISES -POLL A Sept. 26-30 Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll found that 45% of American adults believed Trump “should be impeached,” compared with 37% in a similar poll that ran last week. Forty-one percent said Trump should not be impeached and 15% said they “don’t know.” Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared on Monday to put to rest speculation he would use his position to derail any impeachment effort by the Democratic-led House by avoiding a trial at all. The Republicans control the Senate and have been largely muted about the allegations and inquiries into fellow-Republican Trump. If the House approves bringing charges, known as “articles of impeachment,” against a president, the process moves to the Senate, where there would be a trial. “I would have no choice but to take it up,” McConnell told CNBC. “Under the Senate rules, we are required to take it up if the House does go down that path. “The Senate impeachment rules are very clear.” Trump spent much of the day directing his ire at the Democrat leading the House inquiry, suggesting on Twitter that U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, should be arrested for “treason.” Later, speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump accused Schiff of distorting his conversation with Zelenskiy at a House hearing last week. “Adam Schiff made up a phony call and he read it to Congress and he read it to the people of the United States and it’s a disgrace,” Trump said.  In those comments, Schiff said the call to Zelenskiy “reads like a classic organized crime shakedown” and parodied the president’s remarks.  A spokesman for Schiff did not respond to a request for comment on Trump’s remarks. TRUMP SEEKS WHISTLEBLOWER’S IDENTITY A U.S. intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint citing the July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. U.S. President Donald Trump looks on during a ceremonial swearing-in for Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 30, 2019. REUTERS/Leah MillisThe whistleblower has not been publicly identified, but Trump said on Monday that “we’re trying to find out about a whistleblower. We have a whistleblower who reports things that were incorrect.”  Trump has also accused the whistleblower and White House officials who gave the whistleblower information of being spies and suggested they may be guilty of treason. “The Intel Community Whistleblower is entitled to anonymity,” Andrew Bakaj, an attorney for the whistleblower, said on Twitter shortly after the president’s remarks. “Law and policy support this and the individual is not to be retaliated against. Doing so is a violation of federal law.” Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday called on the committee’s Republican chairman, Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump, to convene hearings to investigate the administration’s handling of the whistleblower’s complaint, and said the panel should act to “protect witnesses from intimidation.”  “This Committee should not sit idly by as the President threatens potential witnesses, whose testimony may be crucial to congressional investigations into credible allegations against him,” the Democrats wrote in a letter to Graham. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she wants to move “expeditiously” on the impeachment inquiry, perhaps paving the way for an impeachment vote on the House floor early next year.  While McConnell said on Monday that he would be forced to hold a trial, he did not commit to letting it run its full course.  “How long you’re on it is a whole different matter,” McConnell told CNBC. According to a Senate Republican leadership aide, any senator could attempt to have the articles dismissed in the early stages of the trial, which would trigger a vote with a majority of the Senate needing to be in favor for it to succeed. Democrats accuse Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to get dirt on a rival for personal political gain. The phone call with Zelenskiy came after Trump froze nearly $400 million in aid intended to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.

204,Trump contacted foreign officials over probe of Russia inquiry origins -Justice Dept,"U.S. President Donald Trump has contacted other countries to introduce Attorney General William Barr and a Justice Department official who is conducting an inquiry into the origins of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, a Justice Department spokeswoman said on Monday. Spokeswoman Kerri Kupec did not name the countries in her statement. But an Australian government spokesperson was quoted as saying Trump had spoken to Prime Minister Scott Morrison by phone, and the Washington Post reported that Barr had made overtures to British intelligence officials and met with Italian officials to seek their help in the inquiry. John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, is reviewing American intelligence agencies’ examination of Russian interference in the 2016 election, which led to the Mueller probe denounced by Trump as a partisan witch hunt. “Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries,” Kupec said. “At Attorney General Barr’s request, the president has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials.” An Australian government spokesperson said Morrison confirmed in a phone call with Trump that his government was ready to “help shed further light on the matters under investigation,” Australian Broadcasting Corp reported. The New York Times reported on Monday that Trump had urged Morrison to help Barr in the Durham investigation. The Post, which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter for its report, said Barr had made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week traveled to Italy, where he and Durham met senior Italian government officials and Barr asked them to help Durham. The Post said Barr’s involvement was likely to spur further criticism by Democrats who are pursuing an inquiry into impeachment of Trump. The House of Representatives initiated the impeachment inquiry against the Republican president last week after a whistleblower report raised concerns that Trump tried to leverage nearly $400 million in U.S. aid in exchange for a political favor from Ukraine’s leader in July.

205,American support for impeaching Trump rises to 45% amid Ukraine matter: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"The number of Americans who believe President Donald Trump should be impeached rose by 8 percentage points over the past week as more people learned about allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to smear his top Democratic political rival Joe Biden, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday. The Sept. 26-30 opinion poll found that 45% of adults believe Republican Trump “should be impeached,” compared with 37% in a similar poll that ran last week. Another 41% said that Trump should not be impeached and 15% said they “don’t know.”  Among Democrats, 74% said Trump should be impeached, up 8 points over the past week, while 13% of Republicans said they supported impeachment, up 3 points. It was unchanged among independents at 37%.  The poll findings mirror several other recent opinion polls, which have shown that public support has increased recently for an impeachment inquiry into Trump. Full poll results: tmsnrt.rs/2n3AYWx The American public has been increasingly focused on the question of impeachment following a whistleblower complaint about a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The U.S. House of Representatives initiated an impeachment inquiry of Trump last week after a whistleblower report raised concerns that Trump tried to leverage nearly $400 million in U.S. aid in exchange for a political favor from Zelenskiy involving an investigation of Joe Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic presidential contender. The poll of more than 2,200 U.S. adults found that 34% had heard “a great deal” about the Ukraine scandal this week, about twice the number of people who had been paying close attention when compared with last week. Another 30% said they have heard “some” details about the Ukraine call. When asked what they thought about the news, 43% said “president Trump is trying to smear Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign,” up 4 points from last week. The poll also found that 66% of American adults said any elected official “should be removed” from office if they work with a foreign government to attack a political rival. That included 46% of Republicans, 88% of Democrats and about two-thirds of independents. The fact that a smaller number of respondents - 45% - said that Trump should be impeached, however, suggests that many of them did not believe allegations against Trump or had yet to conclude Trump had indeed worked with Ukraine to damage Biden.

But University of Michigan political scientist Nicholas Valentino said that support for Trump’s impeachment should level off unless Republican leaders join Democrats in publicly criticizing the president. “People aren’t constitutional scholars,” Valentino said. “They trust their elected officials from their party to know the rules of politics. And when members of their own party say that someone has broken the rules, that’s when public opinion will really begin to change.” The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 2,234 adults, including 944 Democrats and 855 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.

210,Mission impossible: Next EU foreign policy chief warns of EU irrelevance,"The European Union must learn to speak with one voice on the international stage and also develop a “military capacity to act” or slide into irrelevance, eclipsed by Washington and Beijing, its incoming foreign policy chief said on Monday. European Commissioner-designate for a Stronger Europe in the World Josep Borrell Fontelles of Spain speaks during his hearing before the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium October 7, 2019. REUTERS/Yves HermanThe EU, with a total population of more than 500 million, accounts for more than 20% of global economic output and is the world’s biggest aid donor, wielding considerable “soft power”. But its complex institutional arrangements and the competing priorities among its 28 member states have long checked its influence in foreign and security policy. The decision of Britain to leave the EU, Washington’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord and Europe’s failure to help stabilize neighbors from the Caucasus to the Sahara have further undermined the EU’s global clout. Josep Borrell, Spain’s foreign minister who was picked by EU leaders in July to become the bloc’s top diplomat from Nov. 1, said Europe must now back up its rhetoric with decisive action or be increasingly sidelined by other global players. “I am convinced that if we don’t act together, Europe will become irrelevant,” Borrell told the European Parliament in a confirmation hearing, calling for more EU joint spending on defense and a greater willingness to deploy EU battlegroups. Faced with an increasingly powerful and assertive China and a United States under President Donald Trump pursuing an “America First” agenda, Europe must try much harder to make its voice heard and to defend its interests, he said. “Europe has to position itself among the growing confrontation between the U.S. and China... we have to promote our own approach,” he said, alluding to the trade war and increased geopolitical rivalry between Washington and Beijing. Borrell, a 72-year-old veteran of EU politics who will replace Italy’s Federica Mogherini, said the U.S.-led NATO alliance would remain the bedrock of European security but added: “There is no certainty about the international role of the United States.” The EU and Washington disagree on a range of international issues, including Iran, and Trump has publicly chided European countries, especially economic powerhouse Germany, for not spending more on their own defense. BALKAN CHALLENGE Acknowledging that the EU foreign policy post, which tries to meld the competing ambitions of 28 governments, was “mission impossible”, Borrell said his priority would be the six Balkan states - Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and North Macedonia - which aspire to join the bloc one day. Borrell said his first foreign trip would be to Kosovo, whose independence Spain has not recognized due to concerns about fanning the ambitions of separatist Catalans. “We cannot be a global actor if we cannot resolve our problems at home,” he said.  Slideshow (2 Images)The Balkan states are struggling to meet EU standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption but must also contend with growing reluctance among some member states to take in new members while existing problems remain unresolved. Borrell said other priorities for his five-year term were stronger EU arms export controls, a policy to stabilize Libya and maintaining EU sanctions on Russia, imposed over Moscow’s seizure of Crimea and its support for separatists in Ukraine. In his new role, Borrell will be a member of the executive European Commission which draws up laws and helps set policy for the bloc. Its incoming president, Ursula von der Leyen, a German, has said reversing the EU’s waning influence as an open, free-trading, democratic bloc will be a priority for her team.

214,Spanish authorities brace for Catalan separatists verdict,"Spanish authorities are bracing for potentially violent protests in Catalonia as the region counts down to the possible jailing of separatist leaders. FILE PHOTO: Supporters of Catalan independence take part in a protest to mark the second anniversary of the October 1st illegal referendum of independence in Barcelona, Spain, October 1, 2019. REUTERS/Enrique Calvo/File PhotoSpain’s Supreme Court is expected to announce by Oct. 16 its  much-awaited verdict in the case of 12 separatist leaders for their role in a banned referendum and short-lived independence declaration in 2017. Jail terms of up to 25 years are possible. Catalan separatism has always prided itself on being a peaceful movement and its leaders say that has not changed. But there are concerns in Madrid that possibly heavy jail sentences for the separatist leaders could unleash pent-up frustration among a radicalized fringe, a senior parliamentary source told Reuters. Underlining fears that some independence supporters are becoming disillusioned with mainstream secessionist parties, police last month arrested seven activists on charges of bomb-making and preparing violent acts for around the time of the verdict. A new group, Tsunami Democratic, has emerged, advocating more active forms of civil disobedience.  As a precaution, Catalan riot police have been equipped with heavier and taller security barriers to protect officers and which protesters cannot throw or climb over, police sources said. Tear and pepper gas have been authorized in Catalonia since 2012 but are used only in exceptional circumstances, police sources said. They will however be ready for protests after the trial verdict if needed, the sources said. Sources in Spain’s interior ministry said the government had already deployed an unspecified number of police reinforcements to Catalonia and could send more if the regional force asks for help. In Madrid, the acting Socialist government, which opposes independence for Catalonia, as do all mainstream parties, says it is ready to overrule the Catalan government and take direct control - as its conservative predecessor did in 2017 after the failed independence bid - if regional leaders break the law after the verdict. “DISOBEDIENCE”? As an alternative to direct intervention, the government in Madrid is also considering using other legislation to take control of Catalonia’s security forces in the event of a violent backlash against sentences imposed on the secessionist leaders, the parliamentary source said. That would only happen if authorities lose confidence in the Catalan police’s handling of the situation, the source added.   The full extent of the likely protests, beyond those already announced, remains unclear. Separatist parties have agreed on massive but peaceful “civil disobedience” if the 12 leaders are not acquitted.  Grassroots groups Assemblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural, some of whose leaders are among those awaiting the Supreme Court’s verdict, said there would be protests in a number of Catalan towns within hours if they are convicted. These groups, which have organized peaceful protests since 2012, have also planned marches over a period of three days from five Catalan towns to Barcelona, where the protests would merge. “ACHIEVE NOTHING”? Some independence supporters say more should be done. “If we don’t do something very strong, like blocking all of Catalonia ... we will achieve nothing,” garage worker Albert Gonzalez told Reuters at a pro-independence rally. He praised the “yellow vest” protests in France and pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. Tsunami Democratic, whose leaders have so far not made themselves known, said on Twitter that it wants an “immediate reaction” by citizens after the ruling, such as walking out of their jobs or classrooms. The goal is “to create a generalized and prolonged situation of crisis in the Spanish state,” it said. The seven activists arrested last month are alleged by prosecutors to be linked to the grassroots CDR, a group which in the last two years has occasionally briefly blocked roads and tried to storm the Catalan parliament. Separatist leaders accuse Madrid of scare tactics. “The pro-independence movement is and will always be peaceful,” said Catalan head of government Quim Torra. In a sign of how anxious separatists are to maintain their  image of non-violence, the CDR and others stress they are peaceful. “(Our name) has been stained. We are not violent,” one senior member of the CDR who is active in the Barcelona neighborhood of Sant Antoni told Reuters.  He described the organization’s actions as intended to pressure politicians. While it was possible that a frustrated minority could be tempted to act violently, he stressed peaceful activism was the only way forward. “The state is very strong. They would always win over us,” he said. Prosecutors are seeking 7 to 25 years in jail for the separatist leaders - nine of whom have been in pre-trial detention for almost two years - over charges of rebellion, sedition and misappropriation of public funds. Joan Esculies, history professor at the Open University of Catalonia, said disappointment with separatist leaders might cause a minority to act violently. But he said there was no widespread support for violence in Catalonia and it would be wrong to draw any comparisons between Catalan separatism and ETA, the Basque secessionist group that ended its campaign of violence in 2018 after killing more than 850 people over almost half a century.

216,Top Republican on U.S. House armed services committee to retire,"The top Republican on the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, Representative Mac Thornberry, said on Monday he will not run for re-election to the House of Representatives next year, adding to the long list of high-profile members of his party leaving Congress. Thornberry, who chaired the powerful committee from 2015 to the start of this year, said in a statement he felt it was time for a change after 25 years in Washington. His district in Texas’s northern panhandle is one of the most reliably Republican in the United States, having gone 80 percent for Trump in 2016. Democrats took control of the House in January, after sweeping victories in the November 2018 U.S. elections. Nineteen Republican House members have either left or announced plans to step aside rather than seek re-election in 2020. Thornberry has generally backed Republican President Donald Trump’s policies, but he did question the president’s decision to take money from the military budget to pay for a wall on the border with Mexico. In March, Thornberry said he supported building the wall, but not by shifting money meant for defense for non-defense purposes. As Armed Services chairman, Thornberry helped win large increases in U.S. military spending; the Pentagon’s annual budget is now over $700 billion. He also worked to streamline the Pentagon’s outdated acquisitions system. Among other House Republicans from Texas departing from Congress are Representative Mike Conaway, the top Republican on the agriculture committee, and Will Hurd, the chamber’s only African-American Republican.  Under Republican term-limits rules, Thornberry would have had to leave his position as the top Armed Services Republican in 2021. ",Politik,2019-09-30 00:00:00,Reuters
217,Pelosi says public opinion shifting in support of impeachment inquiry,"U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Saturday that public opinion is now on the side of an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump following the release of new information about his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.  Pelosi this week announced her support for an investigation after the surfacing of a whistleblower complaint that said Trump appeared to solicit a political favor from Ukraine’s president aimed at helping him be re-elected next year. Pelosi for months took a cautious approach in weighing the calls of other Democratic House members to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump, which grew louder after former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified on July 24 about his probe of Trump and Russian interference in the 2016 election.   “In the public, the tide has completely changed; it could change now - who knows - but right now after seeing the complaint and the IG (Inspector General) report and the cavalier attitude the administration had towards it, the American people are coming to a different decision,” Pelosi said at a journalism event hosted by the Texas Tribune news website.  She added that her resistance to holding an impeachment inquiry quickly evolved from urging that fellow Democrats remain cautious of the political fallout ahead of next year’s elections to full steam ahead as details emerged of Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s leader.  “A president of the United States would withhold military assistance paid for by taxpayers to shake down the leader of another country unless he did him a political favor - that is so, so clear,” Pelosi said. In a July 25 telephone call between Trump and Zelenskiy, the U.S. leader asked his counterpart to launch an investigation of Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Both Bidens have denied any wrongdoing. Trump has blasted the impeachment inquiry, arguing that he did nothing wrong and accusing Democrats of launching a politically motivated “witch hunt.” Lawmakers in the Democratic-led House of Representatives are investigating concerns that Trump’s actions have jeopardized national security and the integrity of U.S. elections. The impeachment inquiry has cast a new pall over Trump’s presidency just months after he emerged from the shadow cast by Mueller’s investigation. “If the facts are persuasive to the American people, they may be to some Republicans,” Pelosi said during the event. Pelosi would not forecast how long it may take for the House to complete any possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.  “It will take as long as the Intelligence Committee needs to follow all the facts,” she said.   Several Democratic presidential candidates attended the three-day event in Austin, including Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Representative Beto O’Rourke, Senator Amy Klobuchar and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, all of whom agreed with Pelosi that the campaign to push Trump from office must focus on policies and not impeachment.

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at the Hispanic Heritage Month reception at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 27, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueNow, a central question for Democratic lawmakers moving with remarkable speed to impeach him is the extent to which Trump entangled both his office and the machinery of the U.S. government to spark investigations that would benefit him personally.  The White House and Trump’s aides have already put much of that evidence on public display.  During a telephone call in July, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to speak with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who had been pursuing a globetrotting effort to find out whether Ukrainian officials improperly dropped an investigation of a company that had hired the son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, one of the leading contenders to challenge Trump when he seeks re-election in 2020.  The president also offered to involve the U.S. attorney general, according to a summary of the call the White House released last week. Giuliani has said the State Department helped arrange meetings with aides to Zelenskiy, posting a copy of a text message from a U.S. diplomat on Twitter. And much of the episode played out at a time when Trump’s administration had suspended security aid that the U.S. government had earmarked for Ukraine to help it contain threats from Russia.  After Zelenskiy mentioned to Trump that the country was ready to buy new anti-tank missiles, Trump replied that he “would like you to do us a favor” by looking into whether the probe of Russian election interference that shadowed much of his first term was a Ukrainian plot. “The core facts of this are known,” said Ross Garber, who teaches impeachment law at Tulane Law School. “The piece we don’t know yet, which is critical, is the why.”  Trump on Friday described his call with Zelenskiy as “perfect”. An anonymous whistleblower complained in August to the U.S. Intelligence Committee Inspector General that some White House officials took a decidedly different view.  The whistleblower said multiple White House officials reported being “deeply disturbed” by the president’s call with Zelenskiy, “because of the likelihood, in the officials’ retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.” That complaint, filed by an unidentified Central Intelligence Agency officer and based largely on the accounts of other government officials, ignited a rapid effort by Democrats who control the House of Representatives to open an impeachment investigation of Trump, opening a new legal threat to his presidency.

Congressional officials have had preliminary discussions about speaking to the whistleblower, but have not yet made arrangements to question him, a person familiar with the discussions said. POLITICAL WAVES The complaint and the political waves it sent through Washington were the latest chapter in a saga that began playing out six months ago. In March, Ukraine’s then-prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, claimed in an interview with The Hill that Biden had pressured Ukrainian officials to fire another prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, to end an investigation into an Burisma Holdings, an energy company whose board included Biden’s son Hunter.  He also alleged that Ukrainian officials had tried to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election by leaking damaging information about Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who later became a central figure in the U.S. government’s own probe of Russian election interference.  In the months that followed, Trump, Giuliani and some State Department officials embarked on an unusual – but hardly secret – effort to press Ukraine’s new government to conduct its own review of those claims, an inquiry that would inevitably raise questions about one of Trump’s chief political rivals and the investigation that sewed doubt about the legitimacy of his election. Giuliani acknowledged in May that he was planning to head to Ukraine to press for an investigation of the Bidens. “We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,” he told The New York Times at the time. He, the White House and the unnamed CIA whistleblower have since made clear that he had significant help from the U.S. government. Giuliani on Thursday posted a text message from Kurt Volker, a State Department special representative to Ukraine, on July 19 connecting him with one of Zelensky’s associates.  A week later, Trump himself urged Zelenskiy to call Giuliani, telling him “if you could speak to him that would be great,” according to a White House summary of the call.  The next day, the CIA whistleblower said, Volker and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, visited Zelenskiy in Kiev, where they gave him advice on “how to navigate the demands that the President had made.”  At the same time, Trump had put on hold nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine.  The CIA whistleblower said the order to suspend aid payments “had come directly from the President” and that officials were “unaware of a policy rationale.” The administration released the aid in September. Trump has said he did not tie the security aid to Ukraine’s help in investigating Biden.  Slideshow (3 Images)The involvement of U.S. diplomats drew immediate scrutiny from lawmakers.  Three House committees subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday to hand over documents about his agency’s involvement.  “It appears that our policy with Ukraine was effectively outsourced to a private individual pursuing the personal vendettas of the President,” said Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.

219,U.S. airlines grapple with 'unfair tax' that adds to aircraft supply disruption,"U.S. airlines are scrambling to digest a new 10% tariff on European-made Airbus (AIR.PA) planes that threaten additional havoc in a market already reeling from frozen deliveries of Boeing’s (BA.N) 737 MAX. In a statement late on Thursday, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) called the proposed levy on aircraft from Europe that are already under contract for purchase “an unfair tax on U.S. consumers and companies.” The tariff on Airbus planes creates uncertainty for aircraft delivery terms much like the global grounding of Boeing’s 737 MAX in March after two fatal crashes and comes at a time of threats to international air travel demand in the midst of slowing global economic growth and trade disputes.         No. 2 U.S. carrier Delta is not a 737 MAX customer but with some 266 Airbus orders is the most exposed to aircraft levies due to take effect on Oct. 18 after the World Trade Organization gave Washington the right to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods annually in a long-running case.  Click here for an interactive graphic: here Although the overall value of trade hit by sanctions was in line with expectations reported by Reuters, percentage tariffs were less than expected with Airbus planes initially subject to a tenth of the 100% rival Boeing had recommended. Market sources said this was enough to disrupt trade in the cut-throat plane business but low enough to tempt some airlines to negotiate for Airbus to absorb some of the cost, squeezing its margins. “10% is a deal breaker for airlines,” an industry source said, noting that planes liable to the tariff may have to be delayed. Planemakers are typically reluctant to absorb such costs, the source added. Airbus declined to comment on commercial negotiations. On a positive note aircraft parts were spared from tariffs, which means independent repair shops, some feeling pain from the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, will continue to function. Verwandte ThemenSpain says it will respond with strength to new U.S. tariffsThat will benefit Boeing and Airbus fleets equally, industry sources said. AIRLINES REACT Delta spokeswoman Lisa Hanna called on the Trump administration and EU to resolve the 15-year trade dispute “in a manner that respects existing contractual rights.” Still, it welcomed Washington’s decision to exempt aircraft production and deliveries from Airbus’ plant in Mobile, Alabama. The exemption means that the impact for U.S. airlines with orders for Airbus aircraft assembled in Alabama can be mitigated, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said, pointing to no-frills carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N) as one carrier whose order book would mostly come from Alabama. Shares of U.S. airlines rebounded on Friday after two days of losses. Airbus’ Alabama plant produces four A320-family narrowbody jets a month, and Credit Suisse analyst Jose Caiado estimated that the plant could fulfill at least half of the U.S. backlog over the next year at a rate of five jets per month. Most of budget-friendly carrier JetBlue Airways’ (JBLU.O)  orders for narrowbody A321s and A220s would also be among those exempt, but the carrier still warned of a hit to travelers and commercial aviation. “We are concerned about the detrimental impact aircraft tariffs will have on the ability for low-cost carriers like JetBlue to grow and compete, which will harm customers who rely on us to offer competitive, low fares,” spokesman Derek Dombrowski said. JetBlue continues to advocate for a resolution, he said. Delta and JetBlue, with the second-largest Airbus order among U.S. carriers, had both lobbied for the tariffs to be applied only to new orders. Delta and United Airlines (UAL.O) have the most orders for A350 and A330neo widebody jets, which Airbus cannot finish in Alabama. Widebody jets, with more premium seats, tend to have higher margins for airlines. Just last week Delta pledged to buy 14 more A350s as part of a strategy to grow in Latin America through the acquisition of a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group (LTM.SN). American Airlines Group (AAL.O) and Alaska Air Group (ALK.N) also have Airbus orders, as do lessors like Air Lease Corp (AL.N).

220,Trump says 'too costly' to back Kurdish forces in Syria,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday defended a decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, saying it was too costly to keep supporting U.S-allied, Kurdish-led forces in the region fighting Islamic State militants. “The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades,” Trump said in a series of tweets. “Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out,” Trump said. The Trump administration’s move, which opens the way for a Turkish strike on Kurdish fighters long aligned with Washington, runs counter to the positions of even some of Trump’s top allies in his own party. Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator who is generally a vocal Trump supporter, wrote in a series of Twitter posts that he was trying to set up a call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and would introduce a Senate resolution opposing the withdrawal decision and calling for it to be reversed. “It’s never in our national security interest to abandon an ally who’s helped us fight ISIS,” Graham said in an interview with Fox News Channel, using an acronym for Islamic State. “This impulsive decision by the president has undone all the gains we’ve made, thrown the region into further chaos.” ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters
221,U.S. businesswoman Arcuri refuses to answer questions about intimacy with Boris Johnson,"U.S. businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri repeatedly refused to answer questions on Monday about whether she had an intimate relationship with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London. FILE PHOTO: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves his Downing Street office in London, Britain, October 3, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File PhotoThe Sunday Times has reported that when Johnson was mayor he failed to declare close personal links to Arcuri, who received thousands of pounds in public business funding and places on official trade trips. Speaking to ITV, Arcuri said she had bonded with Johnson, who was mayor of the British capital from 2008-2016, over classical literature, that they discussed French philosopher Voltaire and shared a love of William Shakespeare.  But asked repeatedly whether she had an affair with Johnson or intimate relations with him, she either sidestepped the question or openly refused to answer. “I really am not going to answer that question,” Arcuri told ITV. “It’s really categorically no one’s business what private life we had or didn’t have.  “And categorically more important, Boris never ever gave me favoritism, never once did I ask him for a favor, never once did he write a letter of recommendation for me.” Asked about the allegations, Johnson has said everything was done with full propriety and that there was no interest to declare. When asked for comment on Monday, he said: “I have really said everything I want to say about that.” The Greater London Authority (GLA) said last month it had referred Johnson to Britain’s police watchdog for potential investigation over allegations of misconduct involving Arcuri. The GLA said the allegations were that Johnson had a friendship with Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed her to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship. The crime of misconduct in public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The second most powerful man in the opposition Labour Party, John McDonnell, said Johnson had a duty to declare his friendship with Arcuri. “Regardless of the exact nature of his relationship with Arcuri, it is clear that she and Boris Johnson were close,” McDonnell said. “The prime minister is unfit for office.” Arcuri told ITV that after they first bonded over literature and discussed venture capital for the technology sector, she and Johnson began sending text messages and then he would visit her office at her apartment in London, sometimes on his way home. In her phone, she entered Johnson — whose first name is Alexander — as “Alex the Great”. “There was plenty of office space for him to come visit,” Arcuri said. He visited around five or perhaps 10 times, she said. “I didn’t think it was awkward at all.” She quipped that she once offered Johnson the chance to have a go on her dancing pole but he refused. “He sat down with his tea and started muttering,” she said.  When asked again about the nature of their relationship she said: “Because the press have made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer model, I really am not going to answer that question.” Asked if she loved him, she said: “I care about him deeply as a friend and do we share a very close bond. But I wish him well, I want him to be happy.” ",Weltnachrichten,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters
222,"HSBC to cut up to 10,000 jobs in drive to slash costs: FT","HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) is planning to cut up to 10,000 jobs, more than 4% of its workforce, as interim Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn seeks to reduce costs across the banking group, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. The plan represents the lender's most ambitious attempt in years to cut costs, the newspaper said here, citing two people briefed on the matter. It said the cuts will focus mainly on high-paid roles. HSBC declined to comment on the FT report. The bank had 237,685 full-time employees at the end of June 2019, according to its 2019 interim report. HSBC could announce the beginning of the latest cost-cutting drive and job cuts when it reports third-quarter results later this month, the FT said, citing one person briefed on the matter. Quinn became interim CEO in August after the bank announced the surprise departure of John Flint, saying it needed a change at the top to address “a challenging global environment.” Flint’s exit was a result of differences of opinion with chairman Mark Tucker over topics including approaches to cutting expenses, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters in August. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a logo of HSBC at its headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia August 6, 2019. REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng/File PhotoAny job cuts implemented as part of the latest plan would come on top of the redundancies announced earlier, the FT said.     HSBC said it would be laying off about 4,000 people this year, and issued a gloomier business outlook due to an escalation of a trade war between China and the United States, an easing monetary policy cycle, unrest in its key Hong Kong market and Brexit. Former HSBC Group CEO Stuart Gulliver announced plans to cut 30,000 jobs when he took the job in 2011 as part of a program to cut $3.5 billion in costs over three years and raise the bank’s return on equity to 12-15%.

Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsRockets General Manager Daryl Morey apologized on Monday for the tweet, which was quickly deleted over the weekend, but not before facing a swift backlash from Chinese fans and business partners of the NBA team. “As a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party’s repressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong,” Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, said on Twitter. “Now, in pursuit of $$, the @NBA is shamefully retreating.” New Jersey Congressman Tom Malinowski said China was using its economic power to censor speech by Americans in the United States. “And the #NBA, which (correctly) has no problem with players/employees criticizing our govt, is now apologizing for criticizing the Chinese gov’t. This is shameful and cannot stand,” Malinowski, a Democrat, said in a tweet. The NBA said it recognized Morey’s views have “deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.”   “We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,” it said. Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, made references to allegations of human rights abuses in China, including the repression of Uighur Muslims. “Chinese govt has a million people locked in concentration camps & is trying to brutally repress Hong Kong demonstrators - and NBA wants to “bridge cultural divides”?

REUTERS/Mike BlakeHis comments come as Chinese brands withdrew support for the NBA team and U.S. politicians and NBA fans voiced concern about the league’s commitment to freedom of speech. In an open letter to “NBA fans” posted on his personal Facebook page, Tsai wrote that he felt the need to speak about the issue as someone who had spent his professional life in China. “Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for citizens of China,” he wrote. “The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China, is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country’s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable,” he added. Tsai went on to note the Opium Wars and Japan’s invasion of China as historical examples for why the Chinese psyche has “heavy baggage” toward threats to sovereignty. “I don’t know Daryl personally. I am sure he’s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt this incident has caused will take a long time to repair,” wrote Tsai. Tsai was born in Taiwan, holds a Canadian passport and went to high school and university in the United States.  Tsai was a key dealmaker early in Alibaba’s rise as China’s largest e-commerce platform, and now serves as its executive vice chairman. He completed the purchase of a 49% stake in the Brooklyn Nets in 2018 and bought the remaining shares of the company last month. Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The recent wave of protests in Hong Kong originated as a means to oppose a now-withdrawn extradition bill.  They have since continued as demonstrators express concern over Beijing’s perceived increasing influence over the city, which they feel violates the “one country, two systems” status the city was promised when Britain handed it over to the People’s Republic of China in 1997.

227,Factbox: All the president's men - Supporting actors in Trump's Ukraine scandal,"President Donald Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating a top rival in the 2020 U.S. presidential election prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats in the House of Representatives to move ahead with an impeachment inquiry, threatening his presidency. The scandal has also featured an extensive cast of Ukrainian officials. Here are some of the other main American players in the drama. RUDY GIULIANI Trump’s personal attorney, a former New York mayor and 2008 presidential candidate, is a central figure in a scandal that has led to the impeachment inquiry. Acting independently of the U.S. government, Giuliani has pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate one of Trump’s main rivals in the 2020 presidential election, former Vice President Joe Biden.  Giuliani says Biden improperly pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in order to stop an investigation into a company that put his son, Hunter, on its board. In a July 25 phone call, Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to meet with Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to discuss the president’s concerns about Biden. The Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee has given Giuliani until Oct. 15 to turn over documents related to his work. JOE BIDEN The former vice president has long led a crowded field of 19 candidates hoping to win the Democratic Party’s nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 election. Biden has accused Giuliani of peddling “false, debunked conspiracy theories” and has urged U.S. television networks to stop booking him to appear on air. As vice president under Trump’s predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, Biden played a leading role in U.S. efforts to dismiss Shokin over corruption concerns. Biden says he told Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Kiev in December 2015 that the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if Shokin remained on the job. HUNTER BIDEN Biden’s son served on the board of Burisma Group, a privately held natural gas producer, between 2014 and 2018. Critics have suggested he was not doing actual work for the company, an allegation he denies. Burisma has faced allegations of dodging taxes and improperly securing licenses for gas deposits.  Ukrainian officials announced on Oct. 4 that they would review 15 previous investigations related to Burisma, and the country’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau said in September it was investigating activity at Burisma between 2010 and 2012, prior to Hunter Biden’s involvement. The company denies any wrongdoing. Ukraine’s top prosecutor, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, told Reuters he was not aware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.     WILLIAM BARR In the July 25 phone call, Trump encouraged Zelenskiy to work with Barr, the U.S. attorney general, to investigate Joe Biden and his son. Barr didn’t learn of the call until several weeks after it took place, and hasn’t communicated with Ukraine, according to the Justice Department. U.S. President Donald Trump attends Young Black Leadership Summit at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 4, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri GripasBut in his nine months as the nation’s top law enforcement official, Barr has taken several actions that have benefited Trump and caused Democrats to question his independence. He decided in March not to prosecute Trump for obstruction of justice for interfering with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election. When he released Mueller’s report in April, Barr echoed Trump’s refrain that the special counsel had found “no collusion” between his campaign and Russia. Mueller in fact had concluded that there was not enough evidence to bring criminal conspiracy charges, but outlined numerous examples where campaign officials welcomed Russian interference in the election. In May, Barr announced an investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe, acting on accusations by Trump’s political allies that FBI and intelligence officials were trying to undermine his political prospects. Barr has enlisted Trump to encourage foreign governments to cooperate with the investigation and, according to media reports, has traveled internationally to meet with foreign officials on the matter. MIKE POMPEO The U.S. secretary of state, a vocal Trump supporter, was on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy but did not say whether he heard anything unusual. He has resisted Democrats’ efforts to obtain depositions of current and former State Department officials as part of their impeachment inquiry. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel says Pompeo is a “fact witness” and has accused him of stonewalling their inquiry. Before becoming the United States’ top diplomat, Pompeo was Trump’s CIA chief and before that a Republican congressman. KURT VOLKER A former U.S. special representative for Ukraine, Volker was one of two American diplomats who pressured their Ukrainian counterparts to launch investigations that could benefit Trump, according to text messages he provided to Congress. Volker worked with Giuliani on the effort, the messages show. Those communications show he told a Ukrainian official that a meeting between the countries’ two leaders was tied to Kiev’s agreement to investigate the 2016 U.S. election. He later pressured Ukraine to issue a public statement announcing probes into Burisma and the 2016 election. Volker resigned his post in late September. GORDON SONDLAND Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, was also involved in the effort to get Ukraine to investigate Biden and the 2016 election, the text messages show. In one exchange, Sondland sought to quell concerns by another U.S. ambassador, Bill Taylor - who as charge d’affaires in Ukraine is the senior diplomat there - that the Trump administration was withholding foreign aid until Kiev agreed to help with Trump’s political campaign, and suggested they “stop the back and forth by text.”  MASHA YOVANOVITCH The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was abruptly recalled to the United States in May, leaving the United States without a top-level diplomatic presence in a country on the front lines of the West’s standoff with Russia.  A career diplomat with the U.S. State Department who had served under Republican and Democratic administrations, Yovanovitch had been subjected to attacks by Trump supporters. Giuliani said she had been removed because she was insufficiently loyal to Trump. Democrats called her departure politically motivated. Trump called her “bad news” in his July phone call with Zelinskiy. MICHAEL ATKINSON As the Intelligence Community’s inspector general, Atkinson serves as the internal watchdog for intelligence agencies like the director of national intelligence and the CIA. In that role, he handled a complaint by an unidentified whistleblower who first reported concerns about the Trump administration’s efforts to improperly involve Ukraine in U.S. affairs. Atkinson deemed the complaint credible, and decided that it qualified as an “urgent concern” which by law should be shared with Congress.  Slideshow (5 Images)However, the Justice Department and the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, determined that the complaint should not be shared with lawmakers. Atkinson then notified Congress of the dispute, which ultimately led to both the complaint and the summary of Trump’s July 25 call being released. Atkinson said he will fight to protect the identity of the whistleblower, who has been the subject of attacks by Trump.   Before signing on as inspector general in May 2018, Atkinson worked as a federal prosecutor specializing in corruption cases. ",Politik,2019-10-04 00:00:00,Reuters
228,Trump slams Romney as 'pompous ass' for critique of Ukraine call,"President Donald Trump on Saturday called U.S. Senator Mitt Romney a “pompous ass” after his sharp critique of the president’s push for other nations to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic political rival. “Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous ‘ass’ who has been fighting me from the beginning,” Trump wrote of  his fellow Republican on Twitter.  Trump once again defended as “appropriate” a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which has triggered a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry, and said his call for China to investigate Biden and his son Hunter was linked to corruption, not politics. “If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!” Trump wrote. “He is so bad for R’s.” Romney was the Republican presidential nominee who lost to Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. On Friday, Romney said Trump’s actions regarding Biden were “wrong and appalling.” “When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China’s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,” Romney said on Twitter on Friday. “By all appearances, the president’s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.” ",Politik,2019-10-05 00:00:00,Reuters
229,Trump-Putin phone calls in U.S. Democrats' sights: Schiff,"Congress is determined to get access to Donald Trump’s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other world leaders, the U.S. House Intelligence Committee’s chairman said on Sunday, citing concerns that the Republican president may have jeopardized national security. “I think the paramount need here is to protect the national security of the United States and see whether in the conversations with other world leaders - and in particular with Putin - that the president was also undermining our security in a way that he thought would personally benefit his campaign,” Democrat Adam Schiff said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” The Democratic-led House last week launched an official impeachment inquiry into Trump in the aftermath of a whistleblower complaint from an individual within the U.S. intelligence community that Trump solicited interference by Ukraine in the 2020 election for his own political benefit. The whistleblower’s complaint cited a telephone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to open an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leader among Democratic candidates seeking to challenge Trump in 2020, and his son Hunter. Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump, in a series of Twitter posts on Sunday evening, said he wanted to “meet” the whistleblower, who he called “my accuser,” as well as “the person who illegally gave this information” to the whistleblower. “Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!” wrote Trump, who added without providing evidence, “I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason.” The whistleblower’s identity has not been made public. Trump’s July 25 phone call came shortly after the United States froze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, prompting concern that the president was using the taxpayer money approved by Congress as leverage for his personal political gain. The complaint said White House lawyers directed that an electronic summary of the call be moved from the place where such things are usually kept to a separate electronic system reserved for classified and especially sensitive material - a move Democrats have called part of a cover-up. “If those conversations with Putin or with other world leaders are sequestered in that same electronic file that is meant for covert action, not meant for this, if there’s an effort to hide those and cover those up, yes we’re determined to find out,” Schiff said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Schiff did not say whether he plans to subpoena that information. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The intelligence committee has reached an agreement with the whistleblower to appear before the panel, Schiff told ABC’s “This Week.” Schiff said he hoped the whistleblower would appear very soon. Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistleblower, wrote on Twitter that the legal team was working with both parties in Congress and “we understand all agree protecting whistleblower’s identity is paramount.” Zaid said no agreement has been reached and no date has been set for the whistleblower’s “contact” with Congress. In addition, a letter from Andrew Bakaj, another lawyer for the whistleblower, informed Joseph Maguire, the top U.S. intelligence official, of “serious concerns” about the individual’s safety after receiving threats, and expressed appreciation for “appropriate resources” provided by Maguire’s office. The Ukraine scandal arose just months after Special Counsel Robert Mueller finished an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election that concluded that Moscow waged a campaign of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump’s candidacy. Mueller’s investigative report, released in redacted form in April, laid out numerous contacts between Russian officials and Trump’s campaign, but found insufficient evidence to determine that a criminal conspiracy had taken place. ‘DEEP STATE OPERATIVE’ Trump has defended his phone call with Zelenskiy and called the whistleblower a “political hack.” White House adviser Stephen Miller took up the attack on Sunday, accusing the whistleblower of being part of a “deep state” government conspiracy against Trump. “I know the difference between a whistleblower and a ‘deep state’ operative. This is a ‘deep state’ operative pure and simple,” Miller told “Fox News Sunday.”  “The president of the United States is the whistleblower. And this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government,” Miller added. Trump’s former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, in a break with the president, called himself “deeply disturbed” by Trump’s call with Zelenskiy, and not just because the president sought assistance in getting political dirt on Biden. Bossert voiced concern that Trump also asked Zelenskiy to investigate the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which looked into the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016 and helped lead American intelligence to conclude that Russia had done it, as well as the location of a Democratic server. Bossert, who resigned from his post last year, said Trump was referring to “a debunked conspiracy theory that somehow Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the Democratic emails in 2016.” “I honestly believe this president has not gotten his pound of flesh yet from past grievances on the 2016 investigation. ... If he continues to focus on that white whale, it’s going to bring him down,” Bossert told “This Week.” Schiff said Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani appeared to lay the foundation for Trump’s call to Zelenskiy through his efforts to encourage Ukrainian authorities to investigate the Bidens.  Giuliani told Reuters he met Ukrainian officials in Madrid, Paris and Warsaw this year as he pushed for the investigation but said Trump did not pay his expenses for the trips.  Schiff told ABC his committee would decide whether to have Giuliani testify after the investigation fleshes out details of his involvement.

230,Trump has no plans to add legal firepower for impeachment fight: lawyer,"President Donald Trump has no plans to add fresh blood to his legal team to respond to the fast-moving U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry, one of his lawyers said, a stance some legal experts questioned, especially if the showdown culminates in a Senate trial over removing Trump from office.  FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump hosts a Keep America Great rally at the Santa Ana Star Center in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, on September 16, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File Photo“We’re going to use our existing team,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the most prominent figures on the Republican president’s legal team during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. “This is not a legal issue as much as a political one.” White House Counsel Pat Cipollone is expected to lead the response to any allegations in the Democratic-led House inquiry that Trump abused his office, with outside support from Sekulow and a team that includes Washington lawyer William Consovoy. Rudy Giuliani, a Trump personal lawyer who is a central figure in the events that led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch the official impeachment inquiry last Tuesday, also is representing the president.  According to a complaint brought by a whistleblower within the U.S. intelligence community, Giuliani made extensive contacts with Ukrainian officials as part of an effort by Trump to solicit interference by a foreign country in the 2020 election. A detailed summary of a July 25 telephone call showed Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, in coordination with Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr - a move Democrats have called an effort to use Ukraine to smear a domestic political rival. Sekulow said he expects the legal approach in the impeachment inquiry to be “very much like it was with Mueller.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s legal team. A senior administration official told Reuters there are some internal concerns that the White House response thus far has been limited to the lawyers when the impeachment fight is a political issue, and that politically astute senior officials will get more involved. Under the U.S. Constitution, the House has the power to vote to impeach a president for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” The Constitution calls for the Senate then to hold a trial on whether to convict and remove the president from office. No president has even been removed from office by impeachment, though lesser federal officials have been removed. ‘GREATER PERIL’ George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who represented a federal judge in the last Senate impeachment trial in 2010, said Trump now needs a different approach and fresh lawyers. “This is not another political bar brawl,” Turley said. “In the Russia investigation, the president followed his signature style in attacking the special counsel and many of the witnesses. ... If the Trump team adopts the same approach for impeachment, it will put already endangered Republican senators in greater peril.” Turley added that Trump needs lawyers untouched by the whistleblower report or matters related to the Russia probe, which could find their way into any articles of impeachment approved in the House. Alabama lawyer Jack Sharman, a former special counsel to the House Banking Committee in the 1990s Whitewater investigation involving Democratic former President Bill Clinton, agreed that Trump should consider new representation.  “The administration probably would be well-advised to bring in somebody who has some understanding about how impeachment proceedings work,” Sharman said. “If (impeachment) doesn’t happen, there’s very little downside. If it does, you need it.” Robert Ray, who succeeded Ken Starr in 1999 as independent counsel during the Clinton administration, said new legal firepower may be necessary for Trump, but only if a Senate trial occurs. At that point, “it would be desirable to have legal counsel who have some distance from the matter,” Ray said.  Ray said Giuliani can go on television, as he is doing, but that he is likely to be called as a witness and cannot represent Trump in the impeachment process.  Cipollone and lawyers in his office, Ray added, are “perfectly capable” of fielding subpoena requests from the House now, but could have conflicts as well based on whether they were involved in any way in the Ukraine matter. According to the whistleblower report, White House lawyers “directed” officials to move the transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy call from the computer system in which such transcripts usually are kept into a separate system used to store classified and highly sensitive material - an act Democrats have called part of a cover-up. Sekulow, who has been the point person for Trump’s legal response to various inquiries, is chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, a group that advocates for religious liberty cases, and has argued a dozen cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Consovoy served as a clerk in 2008 for conservative U.S. Supreme Justice Clarence Thomas and represents clients on constitutional issues. Of late, Consovoy has been battling efforts by House Democrats and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. to obtain Trump’s tax returns from his time as a real estate developer.

231,Legal setback for Trump administration plan to speed some deportations,"A federal judge ordered the Department of Homeland Security to set aside a plan that would make more people vulnerable to expedited deportation until a court can rule on the matter. The lawsuit, filed by WeCount! and other immigration advocates, asked a Washington court to overturn a plan making undocumented people eligible for deportation without court oversight unless they could prove they had been in the country more than two years. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction on Friday, setting aside the rule until it can be litigated, saying that the people represented by the immigration advocates “would be irreparably harmed by the challenged agency action.”     Previously, only those immigrants detained within 100 miles (161 kilometers) of the border who had been in the country two weeks or less could be ordered rapidly deported. The policy makes an exception for immigrants who can establish a “credible fear” of persecution in their home country. The U.S. Justice Department said in an email statement that the decision “undermines the laws enacted by Congress and the Trump Administration’s careful efforts to implement those laws.” “Congress expressly authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to act with dispatch to remove from the country aliens who have no right to be here,” a department spokesman said, adding that granting the preliminary injunction “vastly exceeds the district court’s own authority.” Also on Friday, a federal judge in California blocked a Trump administration rule that would have allowed indefinite detention of migrant families, saying it was inconsistent with a decades-old court settlement that governs conditions for migrant children in U.S. custody.

232,U.S. Supreme Court tosses challenge to Republican-drawn Ohio congressional maps,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday threw out a challenge to Republican-drawn congressional districts in Ohio that Democrats said were drawn to unlawfully diminish their political clout, a move that follows a major ruling by the justices in June that foreclosed such lawsuits. FILE PHOTO: A demonstrator holds a sign during a Fair Maps rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court, in Washington, U.S., March 26, 2019.  REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoThe court’s action in the case involving a practice known as partisan gerrymandering means that 16 U.S. House of Representatives districts will no longer be reconfigured, as a three-judge panel had ordered in May. The Supreme Court had put the panel’s ruling on hold ahead of its rulings, issued the next month, in two major gerrymandering cases from Maryland and North Carolina. The justices in June dealt a major blow to election reformers by saying in its June 27 ruling that federal courts have no role to play in reining in electoral map manipulation by politicians aimed at entrenching one party in power. The ruling gave the Ohio challengers little option but to concede defeat. A similar case from Michigan, in which a lower court invalidated nine Republican-drawn U.S. House districts and 25 state legislative districts, was also put on hold by the Supreme Court in May. An appeal in that case remains pending and would be expected to be dealt with the same way as the Ohio dispute. The June high court ruling did allow partisan gerrymandering to be challenged in lawsuits based on violations of a state constitution. On Sept. 3, a state court in North Carolina struck down the Republican-drawn state legislative electoral map as an unlawful example of partisan gerrymandering under the state constitution. In partisan gerrymandering, one political party draws legislative districts to marginalize voters who tend to support the other party. The lines are typically redrawn once a decade after the U.S. census, and in many states the party in power controls the decision-making. Included in the 2012 Ohio electoral map drawn by Republicans at issue in the case was the “Snake on the Lake,” which the judges called “a bizarre, elongated sliver of a district that severed numerous counties,” referring to the state’s 9th district that runs along Lake Erie. The electoral map consistently led to a lopsided advantage for Republicans in U.S. House races. The League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union sued to challenge the legality of the map. ",Politik,2019-10-07 00:00:00,Reuters
233,Second whistleblower in Trump-Ukraine scandal comes forward: lawyer,"A second whistleblower has come forward with first-hand knowledge of President Donald Trump’s attempts to get the Ukrainian president to investigate a political rival, lawyers for the official said on Sunday. Lawyer Mark Zaid said the person, also an intelligence official, has direct knowledge of some of the allegations involving the initial whistleblower complaint, which triggered impeachment proceedings against the Republican president. The emergence of a second protected witness complicates efforts by Trump and his Republican supporters to dismiss the complaint as politically motivated hearsay and may strengthen the Democrats’ case against him. The complaint, filed with the inspector general on Aug. 12, cited information received from half a dozen U.S. officials expressing concern that Trump was using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country as he seeks re-election to a second term in 2020. It also alleged that Trump leveraged $400 million in aid to secure a promise from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate a Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. “I can confirm that my firm and my team represent multiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying August 12, 2019, disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General,” Andrew Bakaj, a second lawyer, said on Twitter. Bakaj declined further comment. Zaid said the whistleblower had spoken with the inspector general as part of an initial examination of the whistleblower complaint. An interview with the inspector general affords protection against reprisal. Confirmation of another whistleblower followed stirrings of discontent within Trump’s own Republican Party after he called on Beijing on Friday to investigate Biden’s son, who had business dealings in China. Republican U.S. Senators Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse and Susan Collins have expressed concerns about Trump reaching out to foreign countries to help him in his 2020 re-election bid.  However, other Republicans stood firmly in support of Trump on news shows on Sunday, echoing the president’s insistence that there was nothing wrong with his Ukraine call and dismissing his entreaty to China as a joke, even though Trump continues to raise the issue. “I doubt if the China comment was serious to tell you the truth,” U.S. Senator Roy Blunt, a Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Verwandte ThemenPompeo not complying with impeachment probe subpoena: lawmaker“I don’t imagine that’s what he was doing. Certainly we shouldn’t expect the Chinese, the Russians or any of our national security adversaries to be helpful in any way.” Trump has alleged that Hunter Biden profited in his business dealings in both Ukraine and China from his father’s position, and that Joe Biden, as vice president, pushed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to impede a probe of a company tied to his son. However, there has been no evidence of any wrongdoing. “The Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple!” Trump exclaimed on Twitter on Sunday.  Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said Trump had “sent his administration into a tailspin by trying to bully a foreign country into spreading a comprehensively debunked conspiracy theory about the vice president” and he predicted Trump would lose “the old-fashioned way: an intervention by his own country - courtesy of the American people - in 2020.”  DO-SOMETHING DEMOCRATS The telephone call with Zelenskiy, a summary of which was released by the White House, and the whistleblower complaint prompted House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24. Trump’s attempts to solicit foreign interference jeopardized U.S. election integrity and threatened national security, she said. The investigation could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate. Republicans who control the Senate have shown little appetite for ousting Trump. Democrats said any finding that Trump withheld taxpayer money, already approved by Congress to help Ukraine fight Russian aggression, in exchange for a favor from Zelenskiy would strengthen the case against him. Trump has maintained there was no “quid pro quo” in his request of the Ukrainian president, but text messages released last week have heightened Democrats’ concerns. In the texts, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Kurt Volker, told a Zelenskiy adviser a meeting with Trump could be set up if  Zelenskiy convinced the U.S. president he would pursue an investigation, while another State Department official expressed unease over the withholding of aid. The committees leading the impeachment inquiry released the texts after Volker testified on Thursday.

Engel’s panel issued a subpoena for Pompeo on Sept. 27. The deadline for those documents expired on Friday. ",Politik,2019-10-06 00:00:00,Reuters
235,"Et tu, Mitt? Trump blasts Republican senator as impeachment battle heats up","U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday opened a new front in the impeachment battle that threatens his administration, blasting a prominent member of his party for criticizing his push to get foreign nations to probe a leading Democratic rival. The Republican president, who launched a stream of invective at Democrats and the media this week as an impeachment probe in Congress widened, tweeted that U.S. Senator Mitt Romney was a “pompous ‘ass’ who has been fighting me from the beginning.” Romney, who lost the 2012 election to Democratic incumbent President Barack Obama, criticized Trump on Friday for asking China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The Utah Republican said Trump’s appeal to China was “wrong and appalling.” In a later tweet, Trump said he was hearing that people in Utah regretted electing Romney to the Senate in 2018. “I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY,” Trump wrote. Trump also defended again as “appropriate” the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that triggered the impeachment inquiry in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, and said his call for China to investigate Biden and his son Hunter was linked to corruption, not politics. Another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, on Saturday also criticized Trump for exhorting China to investigate the Bidens, calling it “completely inappropriate” in remarks to reporters at an event in her home state, according to the Bangor Daily News. “I thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent,” Collins said, according to the local report. House Democrats are examining whether there are grounds to impeach Trump based on a whistleblower’s complaint that said he asked Zelenskiy to help probe the Bidens. Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company for several years. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a Trump ally, said on Saturday the State Department had issued an initial response to a request by the House Foreign Affairs Committee for documents tied to U.S. contacts with the Ukrainian government. The panel issued Pompeo a subpoena on Sept. 27. Verwandte ThemenGiuliani plays down role in proposed Ukraine statement on corruption“The State Department sent a letter last night to Congress, which is our initial response to the document request. We will obviously do all the things we are required to by law,” Pompeo said in a news conference in Greece. He did not elaborate on the contents of the letter. An official from the House Foreign Affairs Committee said in a statement to Reuters that Pompeo had “failed to meet the deadline to produce documents required by the subpoena,” but confirmed the State Department had contacted the three House committees involved in the probes. “We hope the department will cooperate in full promptly,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  ‘GOTCHA GAME’ Pompeo, who has acknowledged he listened to the July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskiy, objected last week to efforts by Democrats to obtain depositions from current and former department officials. Asked at another event on Saturday if there were any red flags in the Ukraine saga that required further investigation, Pompeo said he did not think the audience was interested in hearing about the issue.”This is what’s wrong, when the world doesn’t focus on the things that are right, the things that matter, the things that impact real people’s lives and instead you get caught up in silly gotcha game?” he said.He also addressed a notion Trump has long held that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a theory that runs counter to the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that it was Russia that meddled in the campaign.  Pompeo said “governments have an obligation and indeed a duty to make sure that elections happen with integrity, without interference from any government, whether that’s the Ukrainian government or any other.” Lawmakers are looking at whether Trump jeopardized national security and the integrity of U.S. elections for personal political gain. Trump has called the impeachment investigation a “hoax” and accused the media and Democrats of corruption. Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, told Reuters in a phone interview on Saturday that the president in the July 25 call had not offered his Ukrainian counterpart any “quid pro quo” for his cooperation in probing Biden and his son. “One thing clear about the conversation is, there’s no quid pro quo,” said the former New York mayor, who has emerged as a central figure in the scandal. The House Intelligence Committee has issued a subpoena to Giuliani, setting an Oct. 15 deadline for him to turn over documents related to his work with Ukrainians on Trump’s behalf.    House Democrats subpoenaed the White House for documents on Friday. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said the subpoena “changes nothing” and that it would be ultimately shown that Trump did nothing wrong.  The probe could lead to approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove Trump from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate.

Although Trump’s Senate firewall has no visible cracks so far, Romney’s willingness to step out of formation and criticize Trump over his calls for foreign investigations of a political opponent could act as a catalyst for others.    Romney savaged Trump during the 2016 campaign, calling him a “con man” who was unfit for the presidency, but the two men later set aside their differences. Trump endorsed Romney’s political comeback last year. ",Politik,2019-10-05 00:00:00,Reuters
